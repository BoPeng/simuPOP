# Release workflow: build wheels for all platforms and upload to PyPI
#
# Triggers:
#   - On GitHub release creation
#   - Manual dispatch (workflow_dispatch)
#
# To release:
#   1. Update version in src/simuPOP/_version.py
#   2. Create a GitHub release with a tag like "v1.1.18"
#   3. This workflow will automatically build and upload to PyPI
