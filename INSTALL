### Install using conda

If you have Anaconda installed, you can install simuPOP with command

```
conda install -c conda-forge simuPOP
```

### Compile from source

If you are working with a development version of simuPOP or an unsupported platform, you may need to install simuPOP from source.

Generally speaking, you will need a recent C/C++ compiler that supports the `c++17` standard and zlib.

#### Checkout the simuPOP source code

Using any git client, checkout simuPOP from https://github.com/BoPeng/simuPOP.

#### Linux

Linux systems generally have gcc installed. To compile simuPOP from source, you need to

first install libz and zlib.h
```
sudo apt-get install zlib1g
conda install -c conda-forge zlib
```

then run

```
python setup.py install
```


#### Windows

You will need a C++ compiler from Visual Studio. A community version can be downloaded from Microsoft free of charge.
After you have install MSVC, run

```
conda install -c conda-forge vs2022_win-64
```
to make VC available to conda, and

```
conda install -c conda-forge zlib
```
to install zlib.


You can then compile simuPOP with command
```
python setup.py install
```
