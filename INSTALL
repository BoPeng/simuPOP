Using any git client, checkout simuPOP from https://github.com/BoPeng/simuPOP.

#### Linux

Linux systems generally have gcc installed. To compile simuPOP from source, just run

```

#### Windows

You will need a C++ compiler from Visual Studio. A community version can be downloaded from Microsoft free of charge.
After you have install MSVC, run

```
conda install -c conda-forge vs2022_win-64
```
to make VC available to conda, and

```
conda install -c conda-forge zlib
```
to install zlib.


You can then compile simuPOP with command
