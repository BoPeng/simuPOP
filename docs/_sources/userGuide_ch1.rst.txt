.. topic:: Abstract

   simuPOP is a general-purpose individual-based forward-time population genetics
   simulation environment. Unlike coalescent-based programs, simuPOP evolves
   populations forward in time, subject to arbitrary number of genetic and
   environmental forces such as mutation, recombination, migration and
   Population/subpopulation size changes. In contrast to competing applications
   that use command-line options or configuration files to direct the execution of
   a limited number of predefined evolutionary scenarios, users of simuPOP's
   scripting interface could make use of many of its unique features, such as
   customized chromosome types, arbitrary nonrandom mating schemes, virtual
   subpopulations, information fields and Python operators, to construct and study
   almost arbitrarily complex evolutionary scenarios.

   simuPOP is provided as a number of Python modules, which consist of a large
   number of Python objects and functions, including population, mating schemes,
   operators (objects that manipulate populations) and simulators to coordinate the
   evolutionary processes. It is the users' responsibility to write a Python script
   to glue these pieces together and form a simulation. At a more user-friendly
   level, an increasing number of functions and scripts contributed by simuPOP
   users is available in the online simuPOP cookbook. They provide useful functions
   for different applications (e.g. load and manipulate HapMap samples, import and
   export files from another application) and allow users who are unfamiliar with
   simuPOP to perform a large number of simulations ranging from basic population
   genetics models to generating datasets under complex evolutionary scenarios.

   This user's guide shows you how to install and use simuPOP using a large number
   of examples. It describes all important concepts and features of simuPOP and
   demonstrates how to use them in a simuPOP script. Although the new Python 3.x
   releases are incompatible with Python 2.x, examples in this book are written in
   a style that is compatible with both versions of Python. For a complete and
   detailed description about all simuPOP functions and classes, please refer to
   the *simuPOP Reference Manual*. All resources, including a pdf version of this
   guide and a mailing list can be found at the simuPOP homepage
   ``https://github.com/BoPeng/simuPOP``.
