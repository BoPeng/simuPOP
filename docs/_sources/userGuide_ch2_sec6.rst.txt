==================

If you are new to Python, it is recommended that you borrow a Python book, or at
least go through the following online Python tutorials:

#. The Python tutorial (``http://docs.python.org/tut/tut.html``)

#. Other online tutorials listed at ``http://www.python.org/doc/``

If you are new to simuPOP, please read this guide before you dive into *the
simuPOP reference manual*, which describes all the details of simuPOP but does
not show you how to use them. Both documents are available online at
``https://github.com/BoPeng/simuPOP`` in both searchable HTML format and PDF
format.

The simuPOP examples repository on GitHub (``https://github.com/BoPeng/simuPOP-examples``) 
has example scripts for various simulation scenarios. Please consider contributing 
to these examples if you have written some scripts that might be useful to others.

If you cannot find the answer you need, or if you believe that you have
encountered a bug, or if you would like to request a feature, please subscribe
to the simuPOP mailinglist (``https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/simupop-list``) 
and send your questions there.
