Simulation scenario
===================

Reich and Lander Reich2001a proposed a population genetics framework to model
the evolution of allelic spectra (the number and population frequency of alleles
at a locus). The model is based on the fact that human population grew quickly
from around 10,000 to 6 billion in 18,000 -150,000 years. His analysis showed
that at the founder population, both common and rare diseases have simple
spectra. After the sudden expansion of population size, the allelic spectra of
simple diseases become complex; while those of complex diseases remained simple.

This example is a simplified version of the ``simuCDCV.py`` script that
simulates this evolution process and observe the allelic spectra of both types
of diseases. The complete script is available at
https://github.com/BoPeng/simuPOP-examples in the simuPOP examples repository. The results
are published in Peng2007, which has much more detailed discussion about the
simulations, and the parameters used.
