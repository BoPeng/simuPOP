==================

If you are new to Python, it is recommended that you borrow a Python book, or at
least go through the following online Python tutorials:

#. The Python tutorial (``http://docs.python.org/tut/tut.html``)

#. Other online tutorials listed at ``http://www.python.org/doc/``

If you are new to simuPOP, please read this guide before you dive into *the
simuPOP reference manual*, which describes all the details of simuPOP but does
not show you how to use them. Both documents are available online at
``http://simupop.sourceforge.net`` in both searchable HTML format and PDF
format.

A *simuPOP online cookbook* (``http://simupop.sourceforge.net``/``cookbook``) is
a wiki-based website where you can browse and download examples, functions and
scripts for various simulation scenarios, and upload your own code snippets for
the benefit of all simuPOP users. Please consider contributing to this cookbook
if you have written some scripts that might be useful to others.

If you cannot find the answer you need, or if you believe that you have
encountered a bug, or if you would like to request a feature, please subscribe
to the simuPOP mailinglist (``simupop-list@lists.sourceforge.net``) and send
your questions there.
