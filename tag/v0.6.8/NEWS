<p>version 0.5.3 is out with some internal optimization and better windows
port. Please refer to the ChangeLog for details.</p>

<p>Starting from this version, I will also make binary distributions for
linux, mac and solaris systems. These binaries can be easily generated
through a shell script. Windows binary need more work so I will leave 
it later. ( Complain: windows is the worst system to handle before of its
lack of scripting languages! ) </p>

<p>Please go to <a href="../../bin">binary directory</a> for binary distributions.</p>

simuPOP has been ported to windows! If you have visual c++, it should
be easy to build and run simuPOP under windows. Please see INSTALL.win32
for details.

I am glad to introduce the first public release of simuPOP. I have
tested the distribution on Liunx and Solaris systems. If you can make
it work on any other system, please <a href=mailto:bpeng@rice.edu>
send me an emal</a>. 

<p> Download simupop-x.x.tar.gz from <a href="../../src">source directory</a> </p>

The build process is as usual:
<pre>
  > wget http://bp6.stat.rice.edu:8080/simuPOP/simupop-0.5.tar.gz
  > tar zxf simupop-0.5.tar.gz
  > cd simupop-0.5
  > ./configure --prefix=/path/to/distribution
  > make
  > make install
</pre>

Be sure to read things after ./configure script. The most likely change
to ./configure parameter is to specify --with-matlab=/usr/site/matlab-X.X/
Without matlab, the visualization engine will not work.
