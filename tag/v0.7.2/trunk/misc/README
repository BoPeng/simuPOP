If you are able to use emacs, please find in the misc directory 

* python-mode.el modified python-mode.el. You should save this to emacs site directory (e.g. /usr/site/emacs/site-lisp ) and cover python-model.el (remove python-mode.elc if exists). The major change is allowing F9 to step through my code and displaying actual code instead of "working on region in file ...".

* emacs.python.el you should put this under your home directory and source it from your ~/.emacs . 

* python.start if you put it somewhere and set environment variable PYTHONSTART to this file. simuPOP will be loaded automatically when you start python.

After these setup, the usual work flow would be (personally highly recommended)

* start emacs and edit a script

emacs myscript.py

* maximize emacs window and run (press Ctrl and x together, and then 3) to split window vertically

C-x 3

* write your script, use F9 to submit a line, F10 to submit slected region, F11 to submit the whole buffer to python window. You can use F12 to switch between script and python window to test-run some commands.

Note that iPython is also recommended by python community.
