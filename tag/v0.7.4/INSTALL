simuPOP installation guide
============================

Compiled libraries for Linux, windows XP, Solaris and MacOSX are provided.
In most cases, you will only need to download simuPOP and follow the usual
installation process of your platform. This file shows you how to install
simuPOP binaries and other recommended Python components; and how to build
simuPOP when none of the binaries work for you, or, more importantly,
if you would like to compile simuPOP using intel C++ for 20% or more
performance boost.


A complete simuPOP environment is consist of the following:

Required
---------

1. Python   simuPOP is provided as python modules so a working python is 
            required.
2. simuPOP  the simuPOP modules			


Optional
---------
1. R         R statistical computing environment, for plotting and 
             statistical analysis
2. RPy       Python module that provides link between R and Python
3. wxPython  simuPOP can use wxPython instead of Tkinter if wxPython
             is available. Some functions can also use wxPython. The most
             common one is ListVars()


Installing Python
==================

simuPOP works as a python library so a working version of python is 
required. Python is widely available on Linux/Mac systems but not for
windows. For windows system, you can use 

  - Official python  http://www.python.org, or
  - ActiveState python  http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePython/ 

To test if you have python installed, open a terminal (or command window) 
and type in the command

  > python


Installing simuPOP (binary)
============================

Download the latest simuPOP binary that matches your python distribution. 
For example, if you have enthough Python 2.3.3 installed, you should 
download simupop-x.x.x-py23-win32.exe. The installation procedure is
platform dependent and should be familiar to you. 


Windows/ .exe
--------------

Double click the downloaded .exe file, follow the instructions. SimuPOP
libraries will be installed to the Python site-packages directory. 

Linux, MacOSX, Solaris / .tar.gz
---------------------------------

Unpack the file with

  > tar -zxf simuPOP-XXX.tar.gz 

then copy files to appripriate places or set PYTHONPATH.


Linux / .rpm
-------------

Install with command

  > rpm -ihv simuPOP-XXX.rpm



Installing R/RPy
================

windows users
-------------

Install R, and then Rpy using the windows installers. 

Linux users
------------

You first need to check if R is available as shared libraries (existence of libR.so).
if R or libR is not available, you should install it from rpm, or build R by yourself.
The procedure is:

  - download the latest R source code
  - unpack, for example,
    > tar zxf R-2.1.0.tar.gz
  - build R with --enable-R-shlib
    > cd R-2.1.0
    > ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-R-shlib
    > make; make install

  NOTE: if you go not have administrative previlege, use can install R locally
  by using ./configure --prefix=/home/username/R ...

Then, you can build Rpy by  

  - download the latest Rpy source code
  - unpack, for example 
    > tar zxf rpy-0.4.1.tar.gz
  - build rpy
    > cd rpy-0.4.1
    > python setup.py install


Installing wxPython
====================

There are detailed instructions at wxPython homepage.



Build simuPOP from Source
==========================

There are several reasons to build simuPOP from source. The most important one is
performance: for example, simuPOP built with intel C++ compiler (icc) usually
runs 20% to 30% faster than g++ compiled ones. Since intel C++ for linux is 
free for non-commercial users, using intel C++ is a good choice on linux systems.


NOTE:
  If you only need to compile simuPOP, you do not need to install
  SWIG. If you have modified simuPOP source code, you will have to 
  install SWIG to generate wrap files for your new code.


Windows system with cygwin/mingw32 g++ compiler (free)
-------------------------------------------------------

  1. Use the installer from http://www.cygwin.com/ to install Cygwin, including
     the g++ compiler and the MingW32 libraries. 

  2. Get pexports from 
      http://www.emmestech.com/software/cygwin/pexports-0.43/pexports-0.43.zip
    (if the link does not work, google pexports) and unzip to cygwin/bin.

  3. Find your pythonXX.dll file, where XX is the version of Python you have
    installed. This is normally in C:\WINDOWS\system32\ or C:\winnt\system32\.

  4. Make a .def file from your pythonXX.dll. 
    > pexports 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\pythonXX.dll' > pythonXX.def

  5. Create a static library (libpythonXX.a) and copy it to Python libs directory.
    > dlltool --dllname pythonXX.dll --def pythonXX.def --output-lib libpythonXX.a
    copy the generated .a file to c:\pythonXX\libs
   
  6. Download simuPOP source package and unpack
    > tar zxf simuPOP-XXX-src.tar.gz

  7. go to simuPOP-XXX directory and run (assue you are using official 
     Python under c:\Python2.3

    > /cygdrive/c/Python2.3/python.exe setup.py build --compiler=mingw32 bdist_wininst

  8. If things go smoothly, you will get a .exe file under dist directory. If you 
    only need to install simuPOP, use

    > /cygdrive/c/Python2.3/python.exe setup.py build --compiler=mingw32 install

    If you receive the an error related to missing cc.exe, 
    distutils is having trouble traversing the Cygwin-based symlink from 
    /bin/cc.exe to /bin/gcc.exe. The hacky solution to this (until this bugfix 
    in distutils is fixed) is to delete the symlink and make a real copy :

    > rm /bin/cc.exe
    > cp /bin/gcc.exe /bin/cc.exe 

NOTE: for python2.4, you can get error saying 
    import error: DSLL load failed: The specified procedure could not be found
  This is because of a compatibility problem of mingw32/msvcrt and msv/msvcrt71. 
  please see http://jove.prohosting.com/iwave/ipython/issues.html for details. 
  My fix is go to python24/Lib/distutils/cygwinccompiler.py, at line 139, change
    self.dll_libraries = [] 
  to
    self.dll_libraries = ['msvcrt', 'python' + ''.join(sys.winver.split('.'))]
  and comment out the following if/else block. This will force simuPOP to use msvcrt, not
  msvcrt70 or msvcrt71 with msvc.
 


Linux-Solaris-MacOSX System
-----------------------------


  1. download and unpack simuPOP source, goto simuPOP-XXX directory
 
  2. Run
     > python setup.py build

  3. create binary library distribution with 
      > python setup.py bdist --formats=rpm
    or
      > python setup.py bdist --formats=gztar
    or install simuPOP directly
      > python setup.py install
  
  You might need to use 
    > sudo python setup.py install
  to install. If you do not have root priviledge,
    > python setup.py install --home=/path/to/simuPOP
  and then set PYTHONPATH to where simuPOP locates.
  
  Note that you may need to use command like
    > python setup.py config --include-dirs=/usr/include/linux install
  if zlib.h is not in standard directories.



Linux using intel C++
---------------------

Because Python has to be compiled with the same compiler as simuPOP, you will
have to build python by yourself as well. I assume that you do not want to 
override system python, so here is what you need to do

  1. download intel C++ compiler (linux, non-commercial version) and install.
     icc can be installed locally. Note that for 64bit systems, the bin directory
	 is intel/cce/xxx/bin, not intel/cc/xxx/bin. Make sure you source file
	 intel/cce/xxx/bin/ccvars.xxx for the shell you use.
  2. download python source. Run, for example,
     > tar zxf Python-2.4.3.tgz
	 > cd Python-2.4.3
	 > setenv CC icc (for csh)
	 > setenv CXX icpc (for csh)
	 > ./configure --with-cxx=icpc --prefix=/home/username/Python24
     > make
	 > make install
  3. build and install simuPOP
     > cd simuPOP
	 > /home/username/Python24/bin/python setup.py install 


Additional remarks
-------------------

  1. There is a scons based build system under src. This is recommended for 
    simuPOP development since 'python setup.py' is slow because it can not 
	use thread (or multiple	processors).
  2. Python 2.5 is not yet supported (due to the fact that swig does not
    support 2.5 yet.)


test simuPOP
------------

After installation, you can test simuPOP and other components by

  > Python
  .......
  >>> import simuPOP
  >>> import wx
  >>> import rpy
  >>> rpy.r.plot(1)
  >>> execfile('/usr/share/simuPOP/scripts/simuLDDecay.py')

Note that the path is platform dependent.
