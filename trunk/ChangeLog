version 0.6.13 - (Rev 278) - Apr. 20, 2006
  - NEW: Add trajectory simulation functions follows those from selSim
         and geneArtisan.
  - NEW: Add controlledMating that accept an generation only if allele
         frequency at specified locus/loci fail in specified range.
  - NEW: add test case for controlledMating. (No doc is avaiable yet.)
  - NEW: implement trajectory simulation follows Slatkin 2001. This 
         works better than methods from both selSim and geneArtisan.
  - CHG: (internal change) abort the original template design. This 
         will make the source less flexible but can dramatically improve
         development time.
  - CHG: add separator to simuOpt's parameter specification.
  - NEW: add controlledRandomMating and controlledBinomialSelection which
         implement a quicker alternative to controlledMating. 
  - CHG: simuComplexDisease.py has been re-written.
  - NEW: add TurnOnDebugWithName(name) and the ability to set SIMUDEBUG
         to turn on certain debug mode.
  - BUG: fixed a bug about s_shallowCopied flag of population.
  - CHG: Remove starting allele and let all allele start from 0. tests 
         and scripts have been modified. These changes can make binary
         and other modules behave the same.
  - CHG: (internal change) upgrade to boost 1.33.1. This allows me to use
         boost::iostream for instant file compression.
  - NEW: File format change that compress population genotype before it is
         saved. This will greatly reduce the file size of saved populations.
  - NEW: add compress=True option to savePopulation(). For a large file:
         Before: txt: 496M, 58s load, 24s write
		         xml: 169M, 19s load, ? write
		 Now:    txt: 66M,  25s load, 125s save
		         bin: 51M,  10s load, 70s write
		 Since load operation tends to happen more often than save,
		 this increased write time seems to be acceptable.
  - NEW: let simuPOP handles file.txt.gz extensions directly. Using .gz will
         be equilivalent to compress=True (although compress=True does not
         add .gz extension to the filename supplied. )
				 

version 0.6.12 - (Rev 186) - Feb 18, 2006 
  - CHG: 'not enough case/control' in caseControlSample now generates 
         a warning message, rather than exception.
  - CHG: set the default sample saveAs format to 'auto', instead of 'bin'
         'bin' was used before 'auto' was introduced
  - NEW: the format parameter of loadPopulation, loadSimulator are obsolete.
         File type will be automatically determined.
  - NEW: the wrap files will be automatically generated if any of the source
         files is modified. This is useful mostly for svn users.
  - NEW: simuUtil/SaveLinkage is improved in efficiency
  - CHG: simuUtil/SaveLinkage: if pre is True, the output is filename.pre
         instead of filename.ped, which will be used when pre is False.
  - CHG: (internal cleaning) fitness is implemented differently.
  - CHG: (internal cleaning) randomMating sex determination no longer use bt. 
  - CHG: (internal cleaning) isMale class is replaced by a less fancier solution.
  - CHG: (internal) change the use of pointer to iterator, in preparation for
         compact presentation of binary alleles.
  - NEW: add a compilable (imcomplete) binary library. All alleles are 0 or 1
         and are stored internally as bits to save spaces.
  - CHG: carray can now read/write binary allele. However, it can no longer 
         be a standalone type. It should always be only a reference to a 
         piece of memory. This simplifies the design since we do not have to
         worry about extending, slicing etc.
  - NEW: (important) addition of ba, baop modules for binary allele. Extensive
         tests are needed but it is in working status now, including the arrGenotype
         function series.
  - NEW: you can now directly compare individuals and populations in python.
  - CHG: carray is no longer a standalone type. (You can not create it in python)
  - NEW: under DBG_MATING, size of each family is outputed as pop.dvars().famSizes
  - NEW: initByFreq now recognize binary library and set 0,1 instead of 1,2,...
  - NEW: Complete test cases for all operators.
  - CHG: remove sep parameter of operators. Users need separator between output of
         operators can use a output() operator manually. (sep is originally a bad idea.)
  - NEW: (internal) Adapt the interface file and swig commands to SWIG 1.3.28.
  - CHG: simuComplexDisease.py uses binary modules for SNP markers.

version 0.6.11 - (Rev 119) - Jan 19, 2006
  - DOC: add examples of penetrance operators to the reference manual.
  - DOC: document using pyOperator to build pure-python operators
  - NEW: check return value of pyPenetrance function to be within [0,1]
  - NEW: add operator continueIf, in addition to terminateIf
  - NEW: add 's' behavior to operator pause, which will invoke an interactive
         python shell. Current population is by default exposed to the main 
         dictionary as variable 'pop. This can be controled by parameter 
         exposePop and popName.
  - TST: add test case test_opPause.py
  - NEW: add name parameter to population::exposeInfo and population::exposeAffectedness
  - NEW: add subPop parameter to population::removeIndividual
  - DOC: add full member function of population object list to reference manual
  - DOC: add genotypic structure function list to reference manual
  - DOC: add individual function list to refernce manual
  - CHG: rename basicPentrance, basicSelector and basicQuanTrait to 
         mapPenetrance etc
  - NEW: add multi-locus support to mapPenetrance, maPenetrance (and selector,
         quantrait) except for locus, you can specify loci, and a longer map 
         or array of values.
  - NEW: pyOperator can now be a during-mating operator. Pass a python function
         func(pop, offspring, dad, mom, param) and set stage=DuringMating will do.
  - BUG: fix another memory leak problem when an internal population is exposed
  - NEW: improve the efficiency of dynamic type finding of population and 
         individual Decent performance boost for pyOperator, especially to 
         the DuringMating mode.
  - NEW: use the new swig -external-runtime feature to generate swigpyrun.h, 
         this allows me to relocate some utility functions from the interface 
         file to utility.h
  - NEW: let simuCDCV.py also trace and display the change of total allele frequency.
  - NEW: add passOffspringOnly to pyOperator to speed up duringMating pyOperator.
  - DOC: add simuPOP coding convension to simuPOP reference manual
  - NEW: add simuOpt.valueOr, valueNot and valueAnd to simuOpt.py
  - NEW: give correct prompt for pause operator regarding exported population name
  - BUG: fix a bug in affectedSibpairSample, which will generate the wrong 
         sample if an operator is used a second time (So AffectedSibpairSample
         is not affected).

version 0.6.10 (Rev90) - Dec, 20th, 2005
  - NEW: add recCount(loc) and recCount() to recombinator to track
         the number of recombination event.
  - NEW: add mutationCount(loc) and mutationCounts() to muators to track
         the number of mutation event.
  - NEW: add atPloidy=[0] to pointMutator.
  - CHG: replace lociDist and locusDist by lociPos and locusPos. This kind of term 
         change should be done as soon as possible.

         to estimate recombination rate between markers.
  - TST: convert test_mutator.py to unittest framework.
  - NEW: add DBG_DEVEL for developer-level debug information.
  - CHG: Make adjustment to how genotype structure is accessed from individual and 
         limit the number of subpopulations to 2^31. Save 8 bytes (24->16) for each
         individual without noticable performance penalty. 
  - BUG: fix a tiny bug about optimization mode reporting
  - TST: test_population is better now, but still way to go.
  - CHG: separate simuComplexDisease.py into simuComplexDisease.py and 
         analComplexDisease.py. The first script will run simulation and generate
         a population saved in binary format. The second script will run the old
         analyses (apply penetrance function, plot figures, apply genehunter etc.)
  - NEW: add more info to saved config file. (Add a command  line script)

  - BUG: fix a memory leak problem with PyObject->double conversion.
  - CHG: change listVars to ListVars for naming consistency. (Captal for standalone function)

version 0.6.9 (Rev71) - Nov, 19th,  2005
  - add pyOperator, the ultimate hybrid operator, this will considerably simplify many
    coomplicated tasks 
  - start to convert all test cases to PyUnit. This means better test cases and more
    thorough testing. I expect that code 0.7.0 is a version with much less bugs due to
    this change. 
  - fix a bug in initializer (parameter proportion)
  - fix a bug in recombinator concerning direct chrom copy.
  - remove autoconf, Makefile.icc stuff to avoid confusion.
  - fix a bug in migrator/MigrByCounts, which is introduced in 0.6.8
  - add subversion  revision number to doc and binary releases for
    better tracking of changes.
  - fix windows binary import problem caused by mingw/msvcrt. Details please see 
    INSTALL.
  - fix a bug in AffectedSibpairSample with countOnly parameter. (Not able to
    handle None return.)
  - add parameter --resampleOnly and --reAnalyzeOnly
  - remove --optimzied --optimized etc from sys.argv after processing in simuOpt.py
  - add simuViewPop.py (module and command) that can load and view popularion
    property, calculate statistics etc.

version 0.6.8 - Sep 21st, 2005
  - fix a reporting bug in simuCDCV.py
  - support sex chromosome and sex chromosome related mating, recombination issues.
      -- sexChrom() in population::population(), 
      -- stop recombination between XY of male individual
      -- determine sex in random mating by sex chromosome
  - add parameters atPloidy, sex to initializers. Now, you can 
    initialize individuals at ploidy level and control assignment of sex.
    Now, with so many options, these initializers are overly complicated.
  - add support for sex-specific recombination rate. (parameter maleIntensity,
    maleRate, and maleAfterLoci.)
  - modify some features of simuComplexDisease.py
  - release 0.6.8 and set up daily snapshots 

version 0.6.7 - Aug, 1st, 2005
  - Add help() infor for the function version of operators and member functions.
  - use Walker's alias algorithm for weighted sampling. Random mating with 
    selection should be only slightly slower than without selection. The performance
    of simuCDCV.py increased by 15% using this algorithm. This method will use
    a lot of RAM when population size is large (8*N bytes).
  - add compiler info to Welcome message. (to see if it matches that of Python.)
  - change the use of logfile in simuCDCV.py 
  - fix a bug in operator InitByFreq.

version 0.6.6 - various GUI / wxPython improvements. Not released.
  - add wxGetParam. Will be used when wxPython is available.

    when wxPython is available.
  - add some demographic functions in simuUtil.py
  - use grid for tkinter box
  - add migrIslandRates() and migrStepstoneRates() in simuUtil.py
  - find an uncaptured out of memory exception.
  - simuCDCV.py is better, with log file.
  - stop using global variable gen. Add gen() function to individual population
    and "gen" to local variable space. (Avoid using modular level global variable)
    If this breaks anything, please let me know.
  - Change penetrance from 1,1-s,1-2s to 1,1-s/2,1-s in simuComplexDisease.py and 
    simuCDCV.py. This is more natural.
  - Add tooltip to the wxPython version of getParam.

version 0.6.5 - userfriendliness (simuPOP scripts). May 1st, 2005
  - separate user's guide and reference manual
  - streamline getParam, usage, help etc.
  - add scripts folder for common simupop templates

    a major enhancement for userfriendliness. A first glimpse of a GUI
  - fix a bug in saving shared variables. Exam saved format. Full backward
    compatibility should start from here.
  - simuComplexDisease.py. It uses almost all features of simuPOP
  - remove headers support for object. They are not very useful and 
    hard to use.

  - savePopulation saves local variables as well. This is used to save special info like 
    disease susceptibility loci. 
  - Label save population with max allowed allele number.

  - IMPORTANT: population can contain multiple generations. 
    add: population.pushAndDiscard (CPPONLY), Lots of work.
      parameter ancestry for population.__init__
      parameter ancestry for dumper
  - add SavePopulations and LoadPopulations function.
  - add stat(homoFreq and expHetero)

  - read/write, FSTAT format
  - use simple string instead of list to store statements.
  - merge alleleCounter and popStat since alleleCounter may depend on popStat
  - add operator pause for presentation purpose
    new operator is called 'basicStat'
