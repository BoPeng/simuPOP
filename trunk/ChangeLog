  - NEW: bundle boost 1.33.1 with source package

version 0.7.7 - (Rev 786) Feb 1, 2007
  -NEW (build): bring scons build system on par with python setup.py
  -NEW (build): scons build now accepts options prefix, include-dirs and library-dirs
  -NEW (build): try really hard to search proper boost libraries. One usually

  - NEW: add 'useDefault' option to simuOpt paramter specification.


version 0.7.3 - (Rev 470) Oct 2, 2006
  - CHG: change the allele type of long module to unsigned short, since
		2^16 seems to be enough even for long allele cases.
  - NEW: add -c option to simuCluster.py to allow it to se command instead
		of the default qaub
  - NEW: add reference count debugging in simulator.evolve (require
		specially built python.)
  - BUG: fix memory leaks in stator, util.cpp (pyExec) and simuPOP_common.i

  - CHG: remove demo and support for scipy's gplt package.
  - NEW: add infoFields parameter to population and operators
  - CHG: all populations must now explicitly state the information
		fields for each individual.
  - CHG: all qtrait and penetrance oeprators now use info fields of
		individuals (they use variable before). penetrance field is
		optional.
  - CHG: (Internal) selectors now use info field (fitness) rather than
		using its own population variable.
  - NEW: add --useDefault parameter to use default parameters instead of
		reading from stdin, if they can not be obtained from other methods.
  - NEW: simuCluster.py now subst environmental variables, and stops if
		there is remaining $ in the script.
  - CHG: make 'configName' and 'prompt' of simuOpt options obsolete, use
		'label' instead.
  - BUG: fix starting allele problem in simuCDCV.py


version 0.7.1 - (Rev 378) - Aug 20, 2006
  - BUG: Fix a bug in backward trajectory simulation
  - CHG: change the release/snapsot generating process
  - NEW: add script/simuCluster.py which assists submission of jobs on cluster
		machines.
  - BUG: fix a random number generator bug on 64 bit machines.
  - NEW: random number seed is generated in a much better way, and is
		retrievable.
  - NEW: fix analComplexDisease.py which was not up to date with 
		simuComplexDisease.py

version 0.7.0 - (Release 0.6.15, July, 2006)
  - Check all scripts and test cases
  - Check document
  - release

version 0.6.14 - (Rev 341) - June 06, 2006
  - CHG: user's guide and reference manual revision
  - NEW: add a local scons build system for developers
  - BUG: fix the variable update bug.
  - BUG: fix setRNG(seed) bug.
  - CHG: rename setRNG() to SetRNG(), and listAllRNG() to ListAllRNG()

version 0.6.13 - (Rev 278) - Apr. 20, 2006
  - NEW: Add trajectory simulation functions follows those from selSim
         and geneArtisan.
  - NEW: Add controlledMating that accept an generation only if allele
         frequency at specified locus/loci fail in specified range.
  - NEW: add test case for controlledMating. (No doc is avaiable yet.)
  - NEW: implement trajectory simulation follows Slatkin 2001. This 
         works better than methods from both selSim and geneArtisan.
  - CHG: (internal change) abort the original template design. This 
         will make the source less flexible but can dramatically improve
         development time.
  - CHG: add separator to simuOpt's parameter specification.
  - NEW: add controlledRandomMating and controlledBinomialSelection which
         implement a quicker alternative to controlledMating. 
  - CHG: simuComplexDisease.py has been re-written.
  - NEW: add TurnOnDebugWithName(name) and the ability to set SIMUDEBUG
         to turn on certain debug mode.
  - BUG: fixed a bug about s_shallowCopied flag of population.
  - CHG: Remove starting allele and let all allele start from 0. tests 
         and scripts have been modified. These changes can make binary
         and other modules behave the same.
  - CHG: (internal change) upgrade to boost 1.33.1. This allows me to use
         boost::iostream for instant file compression.
  - NEW: File format change that compress population genotype before it is
         saved. This will greatly reduce the file size of saved populations.
  - NEW: add compress=True option to savePopulation(). For a large file:
         Before: txt: 496M, 58s load, 24s write
		         xml: 169M, 19s load, ? write
		 Now:    txt: 66M,  25s load, 125s save
		         bin: 51M,  10s load, 70s write
		 Since load operation tends to happen more often than save,
		 this increased write time seems to be acceptable.
  - NEW: let simuPOP handles file.txt.gz extensions directly. Using .gz will
         be equilivalent to compress=True (although compress=True does not
         add .gz extension to the filename supplied. )
				 

version 0.6.12 - (Rev 186) - Feb 18, 2006 
  - CHG: 'not enough case/control' in caseControlSample now generates 
         a warning message, rather than exception.
  - CHG: set the default sample saveAs format to 'auto', instead of 'bin'
         'bin' was used before 'auto' was introduced
  - NEW: the format parameter of loadPopulation, loadSimulator are obsolete.
         File type will be automatically determined.
  - NEW: the wrap files will be automatically generated if any of the source
         files is modified. This is useful mostly for svn users.
  - NEW: simuUtil/SaveLinkage is improved in efficiency
  - CHG: simuUtil/SaveLinkage: if pre is True, the output is filename.pre
         instead of filename.ped, which will be used when pre is False.
  - CHG: (internal cleaning) fitness is implemented differently.
  - CHG: (internal cleaning) randomMating sex determination no longer use bt. 
  - CHG: (internal cleaning) isMale class is replaced by a less fancier solution.
  - CHG: (internal) change the use of pointer to iterator, in preparation for
         compact presentation of binary alleles.
  - NEW: add a compilable (imcomplete) binary library. All alleles are 0 or 1
         and are stored internally as bits to save spaces.
  - CHG: carray can now read/write binary allele. However, it can no longer 
         be a standalone type. It should always be only a reference to a 
         piece of memory. This simplifies the design since we do not have to
         worry about extending, slicing etc.
  - NEW: (important) addition of ba, baop modules for binary allele. Extensive
         tests are needed but it is in working status now, including the arrGenotype
         function series.
  - NEW: you can now directly compare individuals and populations in python.
  - CHG: carray is no longer a standalone type. (You can not create it in python)
  - NEW: under DBG_MATING, size of each family is outputed as pop.dvars().famSizes
  - NEW: initByFreq now recognize binary library and set 0,1 instead of 1,2,...
  - NEW: Complete test cases for all operators.
  - CHG: remove sep parameter of operators. Users need separator between output of
         operators can use a output() operator manually. (sep is originally a bad idea.)
  - NEW: (internal) Adapt the interface file and swig commands to SWIG 1.3.28.
  - CHG: simuComplexDisease.py uses binary modules for SNP markers.

version 0.6.11 - (Rev 119) - Jan 19, 2006
  - DOC: add examples of penetrance operators to the reference manual.
  - DOC: document using pyOperator to build pure-python operators
  - NEW: check return value of pyPenetrance function to be within [0,1]
  - NEW: add operator continueIf, in addition to terminateIf
  - NEW: add 's' behavior to operator pause, which will invoke an interactive
         python shell. Current population is by default exposed to the main 
         dictionary as variable 'pop. This can be controled by parameter 
         exposePop and popName.
  - TST: add test case test_opPause.py
  - NEW: add name parameter to population::exposeInfo and population::exposeAffectedness
  - NEW: add subPop parameter to population::removeIndividual
  - DOC: add full member function of population object list to reference manual
  - DOC: add genotypic structure function list to reference manual
  - DOC: add individual function list to refernce manual
  - CHG: rename basicPentrance, basicSelector and basicQuanTrait to 
         mapPenetrance etc
  - NEW: add multi-locus support to mapPenetrance, maPenetrance (and selector,
         quantrait) except for locus, you can specify loci, and a longer map 
         or array of values.
  - NEW: pyOperator can now be a during-mating operator. Pass a python function
         func(pop, offspring, dad, mom, param) and set stage=DuringMating will do.
  - BUG: fix another memory leak problem when an internal population is exposed
  - NEW: improve the efficiency of dynamic type finding of population and 
         individual Decent performance boost for pyOperator, especially to 
         the DuringMating mode.
  - NEW: use the new swig -external-runtime feature to generate swigpyrun.h, 
         this allows me to relocate some utility functions from the interface 
         file to utility.h
  - NEW: let simuCDCV.py also trace and display the change of total allele frequency.
  - NEW: add passOffspringOnly to pyOperator to speed up duringMating pyOperator.
  - DOC: add simuPOP coding convension to simuPOP reference manual
  - NEW: add simuOpt.valueOr, valueNot and valueAnd to simuOpt.py
  - NEW: give correct prompt for pause operator regarding exported population name
  - BUG: fix a bug in affectedSibpairSample, which will generate the wrong 
         sample if an operator is used a second time (So AffectedSibpairSample
         is not affected).

version 0.6.10 (Rev90) - Dec, 20th, 2005
  - NEW: add recCount(loc) and recCount() to recombinator to track
         the number of recombination event.
  - NEW: add mutationCount(loc) and mutationCounts() to muators to track
         the number of mutation event.
  - NEW: add atPloidy=[0] to pointMutator.
  - CHG: replace lociDist and locusDist by lociPos and locusPos. This kind of term 
         change should be done as soon as possible.
  - NEW: add simuRecHotSpot.py which is used to generate SNP sample that can be used
         to estimate recombination rate between markers.
  - TST: convert test_mutator.py to unittest framework.
  - NEW: add DBG_DEVEL for developer-level debug information.
  - CHG: Make adjustment to how genotype structure is accessed from individual and 
         limit the number of subpopulations to 2^31. Save 8 bytes (24->16) for each
         individual without noticable performance penalty. 
  - BUG: fix a tiny bug about optimization mode reporting
  - TST: test_population is better now, but still way to go.
  - CHG: separate simuComplexDisease.py into simuComplexDisease.py and 
         analComplexDisease.py. The first script will run simulation and generate
         a population saved in binary format. The second script will run the old
         analyses (apply penetrance function, plot figures, apply genehunter etc.)
  - NEW: add more info to saved config file. (Add a command  line script)
  - CHG: simuOpt does not load wx automatically when --noDialog is used.
  - BUG: fix a memory leak problem with genotype structure introduced in 0.6.9.
  - BUG: fix a memory leak problem with PyObject->double conversion.
  - CHG: change listVars to ListVars for naming consistency. (Captal for standalone function)

version 0.6.9 (Rev71) - Nov, 19th,  2005
  - add pyOperator, the ultimate hybrid operator, this will considerably simplify many
    coomplicated tasks 
  - start to convert all test cases to PyUnit. This means better test cases and more
    thorough testing. I expect that code 0.7.0 is a version with much less bugs due to
    this change. 
  - fix a bug in initializer (parameter proportion)
  - fix a bug in recombinator concerning direct chrom copy.
  - remove autoconf, Makefile.icc stuff to avoid confusion.
  - fix a bug in migrator/MigrByCounts, which is introduced in 0.6.8
  - add subversion  revision number to doc and binary releases for
    better tracking of changes.
  - fix windows binary import problem caused by mingw/msvcrt. Details please see 
    INSTALL.
  - fix a bug in AffectedSibpairSample with countOnly parameter. (Not able to
    handle None return.)
  - add parameter --resampleOnly and --reAnalyzeOnly
  - remove --optimzied --optimized etc from sys.argv after processing in simuOpt.py
  - add simuViewPop.py (module and command) that can load and view popularion
    property, calculate statistics etc.

version 0.6.8 - Sep 21st, 2005
  - fix a reporting bug in simuCDCV.py
  - support sex chromosome and sex chromosome related mating, recombination issues.
      -- sexChrom() in population::population(), 
      -- stop recombination between XY of male individual
      -- determine sex in random mating by sex chromosome
  - add parameters atPloidy, sex to initializers. Now, you can 
    initialize individuals at ploidy level and control assignment of sex.
    Now, with so many options, these initializers are overly complicated.
  - add support for sex-specific recombination rate. (parameter maleIntensity,
    maleRate, and maleAfterLoci.)
  - modify some features of simuComplexDisease.py
  - release 0.6.8 and set up daily snapshots 

version 0.6.7 - Aug, 1st, 2005
  - Add help() infor for the function version of operators and member functions.
  - use Walker's alias algorithm for weighted sampling. Random mating with 
    selection should be only slightly slower than without selection. The performance
    of simuCDCV.py increased by 15% using this algorithm. This method will use
    a lot of RAM when population size is large (8*N bytes).
  - add compiler info to Welcome message. (to see if it matches that of Python.)
  - change the use of logfile in simuCDCV.py 
  - fix a bug in operator InitByFreq.

version 0.6.6 - various GUI / wxPython improvements. Not released.
  - add wxGetParam. Will be used when wxPython is available.
  - add wxPython version of listVars. Much better than the text version 
    when wxPython is available.
  - add some demographic functions in simuUtil.py
  - use grid for tkinter box
  - add migrIslandRates() and migrStepstoneRates() in simuUtil.py
  - find an uncaptured out of memory exception.
  - simuCDCV.py is better, with log file.
  - stop using global variable gen. Add gen() function to individual population
    and "gen" to local variable space. (Avoid using modular level global variable)
    If this breaks anything, please let me know.
  - Change penetrance from 1,1-s,1-2s to 1,1-s/2,1-s in simuComplexDisease.py and 
    simuCDCV.py. This is more natural.
  - Add tooltip to the wxPython version of getParam.

version 0.6.5 - userfriendliness (simuPOP scripts). May 1st, 2005
  - separate user's guide and reference manual
  - streamline getParam, usage, help etc.
  - add scripts folder for common simupop templates
  - add quiet option to simuPOP to suppress initial input
  - add tk support for easy inputing of variables. This is 
    a major enhancement for userfriendliness. A first glimpse of a GUI
  - fix a bug in saving shared variables. Exam saved format. Full backward
    compatibility should start from here.
  - simuComplexDisease.py. It uses almost all features of simuPOP
  - remove headers support for object. They are not very useful and 
    hard to use.

version 0.6.4 - efficiency and usability. Not released
  - savePopulation saves local variables as well. This is used to save special info like 
    disease susceptibility loci. 
  - Label save population with max allowed allele number.
  - merge some parameters through python code. Now, parameters like rate
    can be either a number or an array. Same is true for value, indRange.
  - caseControlSample can takes array cases/controls parameters.
  - optimized genoStructure access, fix a bug about transferring the structure
  - add LoadRandFam ( not easy :-)
  - add parameters loci, chrom, indRange, subPop to dumper() and Dump()
    Dump() is finally useful now.
  - more efficient handling of ancestral pops

version 0.6.3 -  Ancestral populations  Apr. 5, 2005
  - add simulator::getPopulation get a copy of population
  - add simuOpt to control simuPOP behavior, hide other modules
  - add pointMutator
  - change the meaning of rate in recombinator, add parameter intensity
  - IMPORTANT: population can contain multiple generations. 
    add: population.pushAndDiscard (CPPONLY), Lots of work.
      parameter ancestry for population.__init__
      parameter ancestry for dumper
  - add SavePopulations and LoadPopulations function.
  - add stat(homoFreq and expHetero)
  - fix a small bug with end < 0 and step > 1
  - add splitSubPop(ByProportion), mergeSubPops member functions, operators 
      and functions.
  - make duringMating oeprators re-order automatically
  - add numOffspringsFunc, mode=MATE_NumOffsprings, MATE_GeometricDistribution etc
  - add affected sibpair sampling scheme
  - export to linkage format (affected sibpair samples)
  - export to randfam format
  - test parentsTagger, successfully track pedigree info

  - add exposePop option to pyEval (better pure-python operator support)
  - better treatment for carray. (fix a bug)
  - more statistics: Fst, Rst, H_est, H_obs etc
  - read/write, FSTAT format
  - use simple string instead of list to store statements.
  - merge alleleCounter and popStat since alleleCounter may depend on popStat
  - add operator pause for presentation purpose
    new operator is called 'basicStat'
  - Genomic control (use R/gap package, simple subpop vs subpop version)

    loaded into other applications.

version 0.5.6 -  expression. Nov. 19, 2004
  - better shared variable interface 
  - (IMPORTANT!) implement a C/Matlab like language to calculate
    statistics. Terminator has been re-written. Many applicaitons

  - add more functions (abs etc) to inline expression)
  - fixed some bugs.
    
Version 0.5.5, - more clean up,  more examples. Nov. 10, 2004
  - clean the code. Use unsigned long when applicable. Elimilate all 
    compiling warnings.
  - add some more test cases to cover all user features.
  - Some real examples

Version 0.5.4, Nov. 7, 2004 - clean the code. still working on the code base
  - return default value for SharedVariable::getVar(name, default)
    and display warning when in debug mode.
  - shared variables can take string, double, array and dictionary.
  - varParser can now take all kind of shared variables, using
    %str, %double, %array[index], %dictionary{key}
  - DataProvider is separated from Operator and is put in utility.h
  - DataSource is separated from Visualizer so that other operators
    can also use such sources.
  - VarDataSource is provided so Visualizer etc can visaulize/display
    shared variables directly.

Version 0.5.3 Oct 10, 2004 -- some interesting new features

    distribute win32 binary. 
   
Version 0.5.2  -- windows port, smaller distribution, better help()
  - help(class/function) now uses doxygen generated document.
  - distribute tools like .emacs.python.el and swig.xsl
  - remove all unnecessary files from boost and gsl distribution
    this is done by some perl scripts testing the usefulness of each file.
  - ported to windows. see INSTALL.win32 for details 
    fixed two windows specific bugs.
