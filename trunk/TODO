RoadMap of simuPOP

Towards simuPOP 1.0

simuPOP 1.0 should have a consistently defined and well documented interface.

0. Remove the maxAllele parameter of population.

1. Test and document each function and class.
  1.1 Complete and expand test sets. If possible, repeat tests in many 
	scenarios.
  1.2 Check reference manuals for format and accuracy.

2. Replacing SubPopID with vsp, reducing another parameter. 

3. Remove a few rarely used features.
  2.3 combine infoXXX and taggerXXX in taggers?

4. Efficiency improvement and possible use of openMP.

5. Use virtual subpopulation for sex-specific recombination?, for
	sex-specific migration etc.

6. Expand pedigree functions and move the logic of samplers out of sampler.cpp.

7. Check what is wrong with simuRPy.py.

8. Add pedigreeSample and subclass all pedigree related samplers to this class.
These classes only need to define a probePedigree function to find a valid
pedigree from a proband.

9. Add support for different types of chromosomes such as mitochondrial DNA.

Items are marked roughly
Status: Onging (O), Done (DONE)
1. Easy 1 --- difficult 9
2. Workload 1 - 9
3. Requires skills in P (python), C (C++), N (None)

Roadmap: test and documentation:
  3/5/N document each class whether or not they are suitable only for diploid population.
  3/7/P sample script and precise description for each class, put it in online help
O 3/8/N check help contents in C++ source code. 
O 1/4/N Proofread simuPOP user's guide and reference manual
O 2/5/P write more comprehensive test scripts 

Roadmap: scripts:
O 5/6/P add models from population genetics book
  7/7/P write simuEasyPop

Roadmap: simuPOP core
  6/7/C improve support for non-diploid individuals.
O 5/5/C profile simuPOP and imporve efficiency (this is *always* needed for a simulation program like simuPOP)

Roadmap: simuUtil
  3/2/P investigate the potential of python image module. See if it is easy to install and support
  1/1/P add a set of popular penetrance functions. It may be better to let user write their own
        function though, since these functions are easy to write but hard to memorize and document.

Roadmap: A real GUI other than the tk-based simple parameter dialog
  9/9/P wxPython or Tkinter? wxPython may be better for this large GUI project
  5/5/P GUI independent description for each class.
  8/4/P Visualization of active gens of objects.... 
  7/4/P Interactively change population, split, merge etc through menu
  8/4/P output and load simuPOP script

Roadmap: Parallel version of simuPOP
O       feasibility study (give up the MPI version, investigating openMP).

Roadmap: Distribution
  2/3/N test simuPOP under different machines and operating systems
