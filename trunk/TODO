RoadMap of simuPOP

Towards simuPOP 1.0

simuPOP 1.0 should have a consistently defined and well documented interface.

* Continue to polish user's guide. (Add bibtex reference to programs cited
  on page 3).

* For each operator,
  - Check applicability (haploid, diploid, etc), and implement it in
	isCompatible().
  - Check the implementation of initialize() which should reinitialize
	an operator if it is applied to another population.
  - Check the support for subPop parameter. Add support if not too
	troublesome. Document it clearly.
  - Test the operator thoroughly.
  - Remove operators that are not used widely.

* For each mating scheme,
  - Check applicability and implement it in isCompatible().
  - Test each feature of mating scheme thoroughly.

* Finish the pedigree class. Move the logic of samplers out of sampler.cpp.
  Add pedigreeSample and subclass all pedigree related samplers to this class.
  These classes only need to define a probePedigree function to find a valid
  pedigree from a proband.

* Remove most functions from simuUtil.py and remove hapMapUtil.py. Remove
  simuViewPop.py. Carefully document others.

* Remove the examples directory.

* Implement a demography class that return a demographic function by adding
  'events' to a demographic model.


After 1.0,

* Efficiency improvement and possible use of openMP.
  Better ways to profile simuPOP?

* Complete VSP support for all operators.

* add models from population genetics book (for the book).

* investigate the potential of python image module. See if it is easy to install and support

* A real GUI other than the tk-based simple parameter dialog
