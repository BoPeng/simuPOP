RoadMap of simuPOP

* Efficiency improvement and possible use of openMP.
  Better ways to profile simuPOP?

* add models from population genetics book (for the book).

* A real GUI other than the tk-based simple parameter dialog

* Allow parameter loci of operators to take locus name because loci index might change
	as a result of some operator.
