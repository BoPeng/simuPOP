RoadMap of simuPOP

Towards simuPOP 1.0

Items are marked roughly
Status: Onging (O), Done (DONE)
1. Easy 1 --- difficult 9
2. Workload 1 - 9
3. Requires skills in P (python), C (C++), N (None)


Roadmap: test and documentation:
  3/5/N document each class whether or not they are suitable only for diploid population.
  3/7/P sample script and precise description for each class, put it in online help
O 3/8/N check help contents in C++ source code. 
  1/4   Proofread simuPOP user's guide and reference manual
DONE    online help is not complete. Need re-write or fix the processing scripts.
DONE    comprehensive testing scripts

Roadmap: scripts:
O 5/6/P add models from population genetics book
  7/7/P write simuEasyPop
  3/2/P use checkbox for True/False option in simuOpt
DONE    add things like listbox to tkGetParam function. Use wxPython when possible
DONE    add other LD measures to simuLDDecay.py
DONE    add a few population conversion, sampling scripts in scripts directory.
        For example, a script that can load some formats and save to others, and
        another script to sample from them.

Roadmap: simuPOP core
  8/8/C overlapped generations and continuous time reproduction. (mating in aged populations.)
  6/4/C add other mating scheme. (Following easyPOP)
  6/7/C improve support for non-diploid individuals.
  5/5/C profile simuPOP and imporve efficiency (this is *always* needed for a simulation program like simuPOP)
DONE    Sampling now copy populations and result in high RAM demand
DONE    Add association measures displayed in http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/GOLD/docs/stats.html
DONE    sex-difference recombination rate.
DONE    aged population

Roadmap: simuUtil
  3/2/P investigate the potential of python image module. See if it is easy to install and support
  1/1/P add a set of popular penetrance functions. It may be better to let user write their own
        function though, since these functions are easy to write but hard to memorize and document.
DONE    save and load other popular formats like merlin and solar
DONE    add wxPython version of listVars()
DONE    change layout of simuRPy/varPlotter/image 
DONE    save linkage of any pedigree. This is very troublesome considering the potentially very 
        complicated pedigrees.
DONE    add population size change function support like linear growth, exponential growth.
        Basically simple nested functions. Update reference manual accordingly
DONE    add migration models functions like stepstone, 2d stepstone etc. (Return 
        a matrix with given rate and type. Update reference manual accordingly

Roadmap: A real GUI other than the tk-based simple parameter dialog
  9/9/P wxPython or Tkinter? wxPython may be better for this large GUI project
  5/5/P GUI independent description for each class.
  8/4/P Visualization of active gens of objects.... 
  7/4/P Interactively change population, split, merge etc through menu
  8/4/P output and load simuPOP script
DONE    Start/stop for easy debugging


Roadmap: Parallel version of simuPOP
  3/3/N availability of MPI (and/or boost/MPI) under windows
  6/4/C port genostructure to MPI
  6/5/C port individual to MPI
  6/6/C port population to MPI
  6/9/C port operators to MPI
DONE    feasibility study
