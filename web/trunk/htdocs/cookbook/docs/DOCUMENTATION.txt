Where is the documentation?

PmWiki maintains its documentation as wiki pages.
If you already have PmWiki installed, then a local copy of
the documentation is available through PmWiki itself --
see the "PmWiki.DocumentationIndex" page on your site.

The documentation is also available online at
http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/PmWiki/DocumentationIndex .
