Otherwise, authors can post without a name.%0a        # require authors to provide a name%0a        $EnablePostAuthorRequired = 1; %0a%0a:$EnableDrafts:When set to '1', enables the "Save as draft" button and built-in handling of "draft" versions of pages, where: (1) initial "Save as draft" of an existing page ("PageName") saves changes to a new name ("PageName-Draft"), (2) subsequent attempts to edit PageName causes PageName-Draft to be edited, (3) subsequent selections of "Save as draft" cause PageName-Draft to be saved, and (4) pressing "Save" causes PageName-Draft to be posted to PageName, and deleted.%0a        # turn on draft edits%0a        $EnableDrafts = 1;%0a%0a:$DraftSuffix:The suffix to use for draft versions of pages (default "-Draft").%0a%0a:$DiffKeepDays:The $DiffKeepDays variable sets the minimum length of time that a page's revision history is kept. By default it is set to 3650 days, or a little less than ten years. You can change this value in a customization file to be something smaller, e.g.:%0a        $DiffKeepDays = 30; # keep revisions at least 30 days%0a: :Note that a specific page revision isn't removed from the page until the first edit after the time specified by $DiffKeepDays has elapsed. Thus, it's still possible for some pages to have revisions older than $DiffKeepDays -- such revisions will be removed the next time those pages are edited.%0a%0a:$DeleteKeyPattern:The pattern used to determine if a page should be deleted.  The default is to remove pages that contain only the single word "delete" (and optional spaces).%0a        # change delete word to "remove"%0a        $DeleteKeyPattern = "^\\s*remove\\s*$";%0a        # delete any page with no visible text, i.e., empty%0a        $DeleteKeyPattern = "^\\s*$";%0a%0a:$EditTemplatesFmt:Name of the page (or an array of names) to be used as the default text for any newly created pages.%0a        [=# Use 'Main.NewPageTemplate' as default text of all new pages%0a        $EditTemplatesFmt = 'Main.NewPageTemplate';%0a        # Use 'Template' in the current group for new pages%0a        $EditTemplatesFmt = '$Group.Template';%0a        # Use 'Template' in the current group if it exists, otherwise%0a        # use 'Main.NewPageTemplate'%0a        $EditTemplatesFmt = array('$Group.Template', 'Main.NewPageTemplate');=]%0a%0a:$DefaultPageTextFmt:The text that should be displayed when browsing non-existent pages. As default PmWiki uses the contents of Site.PageNotFound %0a        [@$DefaultPageTextFmt = '(:include $[{$SiteGroup}.PageNotFound]:)';@] %0a%0a:$EditFunctions: This array contains the sequence of functions that are called when a page is edited.  It can be customized to provide additional functions to be called as part of the editing process.  The standard setting is:%0a        [=$EditFunctions = array('EditTemplate', 'RestorePage', 'ReplaceOnSave', %0a          'SaveAttributes', 'PostPage', 'PostRecentChanges', 'PreviewPage'); =]%0a%0a:$ROSPatterns: With this array you can give a pattern as key and a text which should replace it when saving an edited text.  See Cookbook:ROSPatterns for examples.%0a%0a:$IsPagePosted: Set to a true value if the page is actually saved (e.g., this is used to tell the RecentChanges handlers if they need to update).%0a       %0a:$PageEditFmt: By default, this is the HTML to be displayed for an edit form.%0a%0a:$PageEditForm: Specifies the edit form for ?action=edit.  Defaults to '$SiteGroup.EditForm'.%0a%0a:$HandleEditFmt: Like $HandleBrowseFmt, this specifies the entire output format for ?action=edit for a page.%0a%0a:$EditRedirectFmt: The page to which an author is sent after pressing "Save" or "Cancel" from an edit form.  Defaults to "$FullName", which sends the author to the page just edited, but can be changed to specify another page.%0a        [@# redirect to Main.HomePage%0a        $EditRedirectFmt = 'Main.HomePage';  %0a        # redirect to HomePage of current group%0a        $EditRedirectFmt = '{$Group}.HomePage';%0a        @]
