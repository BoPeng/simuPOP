text=%25audience%25 authors (basic)%0aA key feature of [[WikiWikiWeb]]s is the ease of creating links in the text of a document.  %0aPmWiki provides multiple mechanisms for creating such links.%0a%0a!! Links to other pages%0a%0aTo create a link to another page, simply enclose the name of the page inside double square brackets, as in [@[[wiki sandbox]]@] or [@[[installation]]@].  These result in links to [[wiki sandbox]] and [[installation]], respectively.%0a%0aPmWiki creates a link by using the text inside the double brackets. It does this by removing spaces between words, and automatically capitalizing words following spaces or other punctuation (like ~). Thus [@[[Wiki sandbox]]@], [@[[wiki sandbox]]@], and [@[[WikiSandbox]]@] all display differently but create the same link to the page titled ''WikiSandbox''.%0a%0aIn other words, PmWiki will automatically create the link path name using title case as a rule, but link text will display in the format you have entered it.%0a%0aA suffix can also be added to the end of a link, which becomes part of the link text but not the target.  Thus [@[[wiki sandbox]]es@] is a link to ''WikiSandbox'' but displays as [[wiki sandbox]]es.%0a%0aLink text in (parentheses) will not be not displayed, so that [@[[(wiki) sandbox]]@] links to ''WikiSandbox'' and displays as [[(wiki) sandbox]].%0a%0aFinally, you can specify the link text via a vertical brace, thus  [@[[WikiSandbox | a play area]]@], which links to ''WikiSandbox'' but displays as [[WikiSandbox | a play area]].  You can use an arrow ([@->@]) to reverse the order of the text and target, as in [@[[a play area -> WikiSandbox]]@]  ([[a play area -> WikiSandbox]]).%0a%0aSome sites also recognize [[WikiWord]] links, in which a ''WikiWord'' appearing in the text is automatically treated as a link to a page of the same name.%0a%0a!! [[#linkshortcuts]]Link Shortcuts%0a%0a[@[[PageName|+]]@] creates a link to PageName and uses that page's title as the link text, eg [@[[Links|+]]@] gives [[Links|+]].  %0a%0a[@[[PageName|#]]@] creates a [[#reference|reference]] link as shown below.%0a%0a[@[[!PageName]]@]creates a link to the PageName in the group called Category.%0a%0a[@[[~Author]]@] link creates a link to the page in the page called Author in the Profiles group.  PmWiki will automatically generate that link for the current Author when it encounters three tilde characters ([@~@]) in a row ([@~@][@~@][@~@]).  Adding a fourth tilde ([@~@][@~@][@~@][@~@]) appends the current date and time.%0a%0a!! [[#anchors]]Links to specific locations within a page%0a%0aTo define a location within a page to which you may jump directly, use the markup [@[[#name]]@].   This creates an "anchor" that uniquely identifies that location in the page.  Then to have a link jump directly to that anchor, use one of%0a%0a* [@[[#name|link text]]@] within the same page, or%0a* [@[[PageName#name]]@] or [@[[PageName#name|link text]]@] for a location on another page%0a* The form [@[[PageName(#name)]]@] may be useful for hiding the anchor text in a link. %0a%0aFor example, here's a link to the [[#intermaps | Intermaps]] section, below. %0a%0a!!Links to external sites ([=URLs=])%0a%0aLinks to external sites simply begin with a prefix such as 'http:', 'ftp:', etc.  Thus [@http://google.com/@] and [@[[http://google.com/]]@] both link to Google.  As with the above, an author can specify the link text by using the vertical brace or arrow syntax, as in [@[[http://google.com/ | Google]]@] and [@[[Google -> http://google.com]]@].%0a%0a!! [[#reference]]Links as References%0a%0aLinks may also be specifed as '''References''', so the target appears as an anonymous ''numeric'' reference rather than a ''textual'' reference. The following markup is provided to produce sequential reference numbering within a PmWiki page:%0a%0aFormatting the link as: [@[[http://google.com |#]]@] produces: [[http://google.com |#]] as the link.%0a%0aSubsequent occurrence of the reference link format on the same page will be incremented automatically as per the following example: Entering [@[[http://pmwiki.com |#]]@] produces [[http://pmwiki.com |#]], [@[[#intermaps |#]]@] produces [[#intermaps |#]], and so on for further reference links.%0a%0a!! [[#intermaps]]Intermaps%0a%0aInterMap links are also supported (see [[InterMap]]).  In particular, the [@Path:@] InterMap entry can be used to create links using relative or absolute paths on the current site (e.g., [@Path:../../somedir/foo.html@] or [@Path:/dir/something.gif@]).%0a%0a%0a!!Links to pages in other [[wiki group]]s%0a%0aSee [[WikiGroup]].%0a%0a!!Links that open a new browser window%0a%0aTo have a link open in another window, use [@%25newwin%25@]:%0a%0a* [@%25newwin%25  http://www.pmichaud.com@] produces %25newwin%25  http://www.pmichaud.com %0a* [@%25newwin%25 [[http://google.com/ | Google]]@] produces %25newwin%25 [[http://google.com/ | Google]]%0a* [@%25newwin%25  Main.WikiSandbox@] produces %25newwin%25  [[Main.WikiSandbox]]%0a%0aYou can also specify that links should open in a new window via the @@target@@ attribute:%0a%0a(:markup:) [=%0a%25target=_blank%25 Any links on this line like http://www.pmichaud.com %0awill open in a new window.%0a=]%0a%0a%25trail%25%3c%3c|[[DocumentationIndex]]|>>%0a%0a>>faq%3c%3c [[#faq]]%0a%0aQ: How do I put a link that will open as a new window?%0a%0aA: Use the [@%25newwin%25@] wikistyle, as in:%0a(:markup:) [=%25newwin%25http://www.example.com/=]%0a%0a%0aQ: How do I place a mailing address in a page?%0a%0aA: Use the [@mailto:@] markup, as in one of the following:%0a%0a    [@mailto:myaddress@example.com%0a    [[mailto:myaddress@example.com]]%0a    [[mailto:myaddress@example.com | email me]]@]%0a%0aSee also [[Cookbook:EProtect]] for information on protecting email addresses from spammers.%0a%0aQ: How do I make a WikiWord link to an external page instead of a WikiPage?%0a%0aA: Use link markup.  There are two formats:%0a%0a    [@[[http://www.example.com/ | WikiWord]]%0a    [[WikiWord -> http://www.example.com/]]@]%0a%0a%0aQ: How do I find all of the pages that link to another page (i.e., backlinks)?%0a%0aA: Use the [@link=@] option of the [[[@(:pagelist:)@] directive -> PageLists]], as in%0a%0a    [@(:pagelist link=SomePage:)   -- show all links to SomePage%0a    (:pagelist link={$FullName}:)  -- show all links to the current page@]%0a
