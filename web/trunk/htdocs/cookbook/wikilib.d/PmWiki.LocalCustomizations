text=A WikiAdministrator can make a lot of customizations simply by setting variables in the ''local/config.php'' file.  Any group or page can also have [[PerGroupCustomizations|its own configuration file]].%0a%0aFrom its inception, PmWiki has been designed so that [[WikiAdministrator]]s can greatly customize the way PmWiki displays pages and the markup sequences used to generate pages.  (This is even mentioned explicitly in [[PmWikiPhilosophy]] #4.)  As a result, the core ''pmwiki.php'' script makes extensive use of [[PmWiki.Variables]] to determine how markup sequences will be processed and what each individual page will output.%0a%0aThe bulk of this page describes how customizations work in general, see [[PmWiki.DocumentationIndex]] for specific customizations that are commonly performed at many PmWiki installations, including:%0a%0a* [[Skins]]%0a* [[Internationalizations]]%0a* [[Custom Markup]]%0a* [[Custom InterMap]]s%0a%0aThe simplest type of customization is merely setting a variable to 1 (or TRUE).  Here's an example that enables ?action=diag and ?action=phpinfo actions:%0a%0a->[@$EnableDiag = 1;@]%0a%0aYou can begin a line with a "#"  (an octothorpe, a.k.a. a hash symbol or pound sign) to add a comment.  Additionally, some built-in PmWiki variables take values other than 1 or 0 (true or false).  Here's another example that customizes the wiki's behavior with respect to search engine web robots (see [[Cookbook:ControllingWebRobots]]):%0a%0a->[@%0a# Allow the site to be indexed by search engines.%0a$MetaRobots = 'index,follow';%0a$EnableRobotCloakActions = 1;%0a@]%0a%0aThe ''scripts/'' subdirectory (below the directory holding the ''pmwiki.php'' script) has many customizations.%0aThe PmWiki [[(Cookbook:)Cookbook]] contains many example customizations (recipes) that you can download into the ''cookbook/'' subdirectory,%0aThe first few lines of each of these scripts generally contain instructions about how to enable (and use) the feature provided by the script.%0a%0aThese customizations are included in your ''config.php'' site configuration. For most scripts this is done by simply adding lines like:%0a->[@include_once("cookbook/recipefile.php");@]%0aand%0a->[@include_once("scripts/scriptfile.php");@]%0aat the end of the ''config.php'' file to enable them.  %0a%0aSome of the scripts are automatically enabled for you via the ''scripts/stdconfig.php'' script unless you disable it by setting @@$EnableStdConfig=0;@@ in ''local/config.php''.%0a%0aNote that you should strongly resist the temptation to directly modify the ''pmwiki.php'' script or the files in the ''scripts/'' subdirectory.  Any modifications you make to these files will probably be overwritten whenever you perform a [[PmWiki.Upgrade(s)]].  Instead, look at some of the sample scripts for examples of customizations that can be performed from ''config.php''. You can even create your own script to do a customization and use @@include_once(...)@@ to include it from ''config.php''.  If you do make your own customization script, you can safely put it in the ''cookbook/'' subdirectory--it won't get overwritten by an upgrade there.  You might also want to submit your customization to the [[MailingLists|pmwiki-users mailing list]] or the [[(Cookbook:)Cookbook]] so that others can benefit from your effort and so that it can perhaps be included in future releases of PmWiki.%0a%0a%25trail%25%3c%3c|[[DocumentationIndex]]|>>%0a%0a>>faq%3c%3c [[#faq]]%0a%0aQ: How do I get the group / page name in a local configuration file (e.g. ''local/config.php'')?%0aA: Use the following markup in pmwiki-2.1.beta21 or newer:%0a%0a->[@%0a## Get the group and page name%0a$pagename = ResolvePageName($pagename);%0a$group = PageVar($pagename, '$Group');%0a$name = PageVar($pagename, '$Name');%0a@]%0a%0a%0aQ: Can I remove items from the wikilib.d folder on my site?%0aA: Yes, the files in ''wikilib.d/'' can be safely removed.  They'll reappear again when you upgrade, however.  If you want to permanently configure your site so that these distribution pages don't appear, try:%0a%0a->[@$WikiLibDirs = array(&$WikiDir);@]%0a%0a%0aQ: How do I customize my own 404 error page for non-existent pages?%0aA: To change the text of the message, try editing the [[Site.PageNotFound]] page.%0a%0a
