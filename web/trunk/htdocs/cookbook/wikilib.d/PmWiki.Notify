text=(:Summary:Allows a site administrator to configure PmWiki to send email messages whenever pages are changed on the wiki site:)%0a%25audience%25 administrators (basic)%0a%0aThe ''notify.php'' script allows a site administrator to configure PmWiki to send email messages whenever pages are changed on the wiki site.  Notifications can be configured so that multiple page changes over a short period of time are combined into a single email message (to avoid flooding mailboxes).%0a%0aThis feature is useful for sites and pages that have infrequent updates, as it eliminates the need to frequently check `RecentChanges pages just to see if anything has changed.%0a%0aIn order for notifications to work, the notify.php script must be enabled in the site's [[local customization(s)]].  Usually this is as simple as placing the following in ''local/config.php'':%0a%0a    $EnableNotify = 1;%0a%0aOnce enabled, the notification system gets its configuration from the [[SiteAdmin.NotifyList]] page.  The SiteAdmin.NotifyList page contains entries of the form:%0a%0a    notify=alice@example.com%0a%0aThis says that information about page changes should be periodically emailed to ''alice@example.com''.  The SiteAdmin.NotifyList page can contain multiple "notify=" lines to cause notifications to be sent to multiple addresses; the "notify=" lines can be concealed by placing them inside of an [@(:if false:)@] conditional section on the page.%0a%0aNOTE: Do not put any spaces around the equal sign! Notifications will fail silently if you have%0a    notify = fred@example.com%0arather than%0a    notify=fred@example.com%0a(:comment this is a really easy mistake to make because all of the other assignments have spaces around the equal sign.:)%0a%0aA number of options exist for limiting the pages that result in a notification.  The [@group=@] and [@name=@] parameters can be used to restrict notifications to specific pages or groups:%0a%0a    # send notifications about the Main group to alice@example.com%0a    notify=alice@example.com group=Main%0a%0a    # notify bob@example.com of any changes to the home page%0a    notify=bob@example.com name=Main.HomePage%0a%0a    # notify charles@example.com of changes to pages except in Main%0a    notify=charles@example.com group=-Main%0a%0a(Note: It looks like these are using [[PmWiki/PageLists | the usual PageList syntax]].  [[PmWiki:PagelistsExplained | More info on PageList syntax here]]. -- XES)%0a%0aFor maintaining arbitrary lists of pages, i.e., "watchlists", it's generally easier to build a [[trail -> WikiTrails]] of pages to be watched.  The following entry in SiteAdmin.NotifyList will send alice@example.com an email containing changes to any of the pages listed in the Profiles.Alice trail:%0a%0a    # notify Alice of changes to pages listed in Profiles.Alice%0a    notify=alice@example.com trail=Profiles.Alice%0a%0aNote that once this entry has been added to SiteAdmin.NotifyList, Alice can easily change her watchlist by editing the Profiles.Alice page, and doesn't need to edit the SiteAdmin.NotifyList page.  In particular, this means that an administrator can restrict editing of SiteAdmin.NotifyList, yet allow individuals to maintain custom watchlists in other pages. %0a%0aLimitations of this feature:%0a* only manually-added links on a trail will be acknowleged by the Notify List (no "group=" or other pagelist syntax, nor any "Group.RecentChanges" links, will generate notifications)%0a* using an [@(:include:)@] directive on the page SiteAdmin.NotifyList is not an operational work-around.%0a%0aThis is probably a good place to point out that edit access to SiteAdmin.NotifyList should be controlled, otherwise malicious persons can use the notification capability to flood others' electronic mailboxes.  By default, SiteAdmin.Notify is blocked against reading or edits except by the admin (as is the case for most pages in the SiteAdmin group).%0a%0a!! Adding notification entries via local customizations%0a%0aNotification entries can also be added via the $NotifyList array in ''local/config.php''.  Simply add a line like the following:%0a    $EnableNotify = 1;%0a    $NotifyList[] = 'notify=alice@example.com group=Main';%0a    $NotifyList[] = 'notify=bob@example.com name=Main.HomePage';%0a%0a!! Controlling notification frequency%0a%0aTo prevent flooding of recipients' mailboxes, the notify script uses a "squelch" value as the minimum amount of time that must elapse between messages sent to any given email address.  The ''default squelch setting is 10800 (three hours)'', which means that once a recipient address is sent a notification message, it will not receive another for at least three hours.  Any edits that occur during the squelch interval are queued for the next notification message.%0a%0aThe site administrator can change the default squelch interval via the $NotifySquelch parameter %0a%0a    # enable notifications%0a    $EnableNotify = 1;%0a    $NotifySquelch = 86400;    # wait at least one day between notifications%0a%0aIn addition, individual addresses can specify a custom squelch parameter in the SiteAdmin.NotifyList page:%0a%0a    # Alice receives at most one email per day%0a    notify=alice@example.com squelch=86400%0a%0a    # Bob can get notifications hourly%0a    notify=bob@example.com trail=Profiles.Bob squelch=3600%0a%0a    # Charles uses the site default squelch%0a    notify=charles@example.com %0a%0aBecause a page will often receive several edits in rapid succession (e.g., a long post followed by several minor edits), a site administrator can also set a $NotifyDelay value that specifies how long to wait after an initial post before sending notifications:%0a%0a    # enable notifications%0a    $EnableNotify = 1;%0a    $NotifySquelch = 86400;    # wait at least one day between notifications%0a    $NotifyDelay = 300;        # wait five minutes after initial post%0a%0aNote that the squelch and delay values are minimums; notifications are sent on the first execution of PmWiki after the delay period has expired.  For inactive sites, this could be much longer than the specified delay periods.  This isn't really considered an issue since timely notifications are less important on relatively inactive sites. However, changes within the squelch time after the last notification will remain unnoticed if the wiki is not even visited for a long period after. If this matters it might be necessary to make the server call pmwiki.php regularly (e.g. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron | cron job]]).%0a%0aCustom delay parameters cannot be specified for individual addresses in the SiteAdmin.NotifyList page.%0a%0a!!Note for Windows installations%0a%0aSites running PHP under Windows may not have PHP's [[http://www.php.net/mail | mail]] function configured correctly.  Such sites may need to add a line like%0a%0a    ini_set('SMTP','smtp.server.com');%0a%0ato ''config.php'', where ''smtp.server.com'' is the name of your host's preferred outgoing mail server. You may also need to set the sendmail_from value if that is not configured:%0a%0a    ini_set('sendmail_from','noreply@foo.com');%0a%0a%0a!![[#variables]] Notify Variables%0a%0a%3c%3c|[[Variables]]|>>%0a%0a:$EnableNotify:Tells ''stdconfig.php'' to enable the notify script.%0a        $EnableNotify = 1;          # enable notify%0a        $EnableNotify = 0;          # disable notify%0a%0a:$NotifyFrom:Return email address to be used in the sent email.%0a        $NotifyFrom = 'wiki@example.com';%0a        $NotifyFrom = 'Wiki server %3cwiki@example.com>';%0a%0a:$NotifyDelay:The length of time (seconds) to wait before sending mail after the first post.
