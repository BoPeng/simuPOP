text=%25audience%25 authors%0a[[PmWiki]] has built-in support for password-protecting various areas of the wiki site.  Authors generally want to be able to apply passwords to individual pages or to [[wiki group]]s.  Wiki Administrators can apply passwords to individual pages, to wiki groups, or to the [[PasswordsAdmin#settingsitewidepasswords|entire site]].  As with any access control system, the password protection mechanisms described here are only a small part of overall system and wiki [[security]].%0a%0a!!As an author editing pages...%0a%0aAn author will generally set 3 types of passwords:%0a# to control who can see a page or group, use  @@read@@ passwords%0a# to control who can edit a page or group, use @@edit@@ passwords%0a# to control who can alter the passwords used to protect a page or group, use @@attr@@ passwords%0a%0a'''''To set a password on an individual wiki page,''''' add @@?action=attr@@ to the page's URL (address) to access its attributes.  Using the form on the attributes page, you can set or clear the @@read@@, @@edit@@, or @@attr@@ passwords on the page.  In the form you enter the passwords as cleartext; PmWiki encrypts them for you automatically when it stores them. %0a* Leaving a field blank will leave the attribute unchanged. %0a* To remove a password from a page (''reverting back'' to the group's or site's default), enter "clear". %0a* To indicate that the page can be edited ''even if a group or site password is set'', enter "@nopass".%0a* To lock a page for everybody but the admin, enter "@lock".%0a* To assign the site's site-wide edit-password to the @@read@@, @@edit@@, or @@attr@@ password for the page, enter "@_site_edit".%0a%0a%0a'''''To set a password on a wiki group''''' is slightly more difficult -- you just set the passwords on a special page in each group called "`GroupAttributes".  First, you can get to the attributes page for `GroupAttributes by entering a URL (address) like [@http://www.example.com/pmwiki.php?n=GroupName.GroupAttributes?action=attr@].  Then, using the form on the attributes page, you can set or clear the @@read@@, @@edit@@, or @@attr@@ passwords for the entire group.  In the form you enter the passwords as cleartext; PmWiki encrypts them for you automatically.%0a* To remove a password from a group (''reverting back'' to the site's default), enter "clear". %0a* To indicate that the group can be edited ''even if a site password is set'', enter "@nopass". %0a* To lock a group for everybody but the admin, enter "@lock".%0a%0a'''''Multiple passwords for a page, group or site''''' are allowed. Simply enter multiple passwords separated by a space. This allows you to have a read password, a write password, and have the write password allow read/write access.  In other words, if the read password is "alpha" and the edit password is beta, then enter%0a%0a-> [@%0aSet new read password: alpha beta%0aSet new edit password: beta%0a@]%0a%0aThis says that either "alpha" or "beta" can be used to read pages, but only "beta" may edit. Since PmWiki checks the passwords you've entered since the browser has been opened, entering a read password that is also a write password allows both reading and writing.%0a%0a%0a%25audience%25 administrator%0a%0a!!As an administrator ...%0a%0aYou can set passwords on pages and groups exactly as described above for authors. You can also:%0a# set site-wide passwords for pages and groups that do not have passwords%0a# use @@attr@@ passwords to control who is able to set passwords on pages%0a# use @@upload@@ passwords to control access to the file [[upload(s)]] capabilities (if uploads are enabled)%0a# use an @@admin@@ password to override the passwords set for any individual page or group  %0aFor more information on password options available to administrators, see [[PasswordsAdmin]].%0a%0a!!Which password wins?%0a%0aIn PmWiki, page passwords override group passwords, group passwords override the ''default'' passwords, and the @@admin@@ password overrides all passwords.  This gives a great deal of flexibility in controlling access to wiki pages in PmWiki. %0a%0a!!Opening access to pages in protected groups/sites%0a%0aSometimes we want to "unprotect" pages in a group or site that is otherwise protected.  In these cases, the special password "@nopass" is used to indicate that access should be allowed to a page without requiring a password.  %0a%0aFor example, suppose `Main.GroupAttributes has an edit password set, thus restricting the editing of all pages in Main.  Now we want `Main.WikiSandbox to be editable without a password.  Using "clear" for the edit password for `Main.WikiSandbox ''doesn't unprotect the page'', because the password is being set by the group.  Instead, we set the edit password for `Main.WikiSandbox to the special value "@nopass", which tells PmWiki to ignore any site-wide or group-level passwords for that page.%0a%0a%25trail%25%3c%3c|[[Documentation Index]]|>>%0a%0a>>faq%3c%3c [[#faq]]%0a%0aQ:  How can I password protect all the pages and groups on my site?  Do I really have to set passwords page by page, or group by group?%0a%0aA:  Administrators can set passwords for the entire site by editing the config.php file; they don't have to set passwords for each page or group.  For example, to set the entire site to be editable only by those who know an "edit" password, an administrator can add a line like the following to local/config.php:%0a%0a    $DefaultPasswords['edit'] = crypt('edit_password');%0a%0aFor more information about the password options that are available only to administrators, see [[PasswordsAdmin]].%0a%0aQ:  How can I create private groups for users, so that each user can edit pages in their group, but no one else (other than the admin) can?%0a%0aA:  Administrators can use the [[(PmWiki:)AuthUser]] recipe and add the following few lines to their local/config.php file to set this up:%0a%0a    $group = FmtPageName('$Group', $pagename); \\%0a    $DefaultPasswords['edit'] = 'id:'.$group; \\%0a    include_once("$FarmD/scripts/authuser.php");%0a%0aThis automatically gives edit rights to a group to every user who has the same user name as the group name.
