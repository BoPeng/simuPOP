This is the INSTALL.txt file for PmWiki.  This document provides
convenient steps so an administrator can have a PmWiki site up and
running quickly.  More extensive information about installing PmWiki
is available at http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/PmWiki/Installation .

Once your site is up and running you will be able to read the bundled
documentation pages.

Here are some quick steps to start you on your path toward a complete,
customized installation:

1a) Put the software in a location accessible by your webserver.

1b) PmWiki can also be run if no webserver is installed.  See
    http://pmwiki.org/wiki/Cookbook/Standalone

2) Point your browser to pmwiki.php.

3) You may see an error message saying that PmWiki needs to have
   a writable wiki.d/ directory.  If so, follow the directions to
   establish one.  This directory will hold your wiki page files.

4) If you want a directory index file, create a file called index.php
   in the main directory that contains the following single line of
   text, purposefully without a closing "?>":

<?php include('pmwiki.php');

5) Sitewide configuration settings will go in a "local configuration
   file" named local/config.php.  Copy the well-commented sample
   configuration file from docs/sample-config.php to the local/
   subdirectory, then rename the copy to config.php.  Edit your
   new local/config.php file to suit your preferences.

That's it.  Next you'll probably want to browse your new site and
read the bundled documentation.  A good place to start is the
PmWiki.InitialSetupTasks page.

Enjoy!
