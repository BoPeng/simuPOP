text=This page has some background information on making backups and explains some basic *nix backup and restore procedures.%0a%0a!! Introduction%0a%0aYour wiki installation contains some unique data in the following directories:%0a%0a    local/         Local configuration scripts%0a    cookbook/      Recipes obtained from the [[(Cookbook:)Cookbook]]%0a    pub/           Publicly accessible files%0a    wiki.d/        Wiki pages%0a    uploads/       Uploaded files (attachments)%0a%0aA good backup plan will include periodically archiving these directories &mdash; or at bare minimum [@local/@] and [@wiki.d/@].  Good practice dictates keeping your backup archives on a separate machine.%0a%0a!! Simple Backup and Restore (*nix)%0a%0aWhen it comes to backup, simpler is better.  Since the pmwiki distribution is very small (about 1/4 megabyte), it's simplest to just archive the distribution files along with the data.%0a%0a!!! Making a Backup Archive%0a%0aThe following *nix command, executed from the parent directory of your wiki's directory, will put a complete backup archive of your site in your home directory.%0a%0a-> [@%0atar -zcvf  ~/wiki-backup-`date +%25Y%25m`.tar.gz  wiki/%0a@]%0a%0a!!! Restoring the Backup Archive%0a%0a!!!! Simple Method%0a%0aYour site can be restored and running in under 30 seconds with%0a%0a-> [@%0atar -zxvf ~/wiki-backup-200512.tar.gz%0afind wiki/uploads/ -type d |xargs chmod 777%0afind wiki/wiki.d/ -type d |xargs chmod 777%0a@]%0a%0a!!!! A Slightly-More-Secure Method%0a%0aThe simple restore commands above will give you world-writable files and directories.  You can avoid world-writable permissions by letting PmWiki create directories with the proper attributes (ownership and permissions) for you.%0a%0aStart with%0a%0a-> [@%0atar -zxvf ~/wiki-backup-200512.tar.gz%0arm -rf wiki/wiki.d%0arm -rf uploads%0achmod 2777 wiki/%0a@]%0a%0aNow upload a file in each group that had uploads.  If your site doesn't have uploads, just visit your site once so the wiki.d/ directory will be created.%0a%0aFinish your installation with%0a%0a-> [@%0achmod 755 wiki/%0atar -zxvf ~/wiki-backup-200512.tar.gz%0a@]%0a%0a%0a!!! Details%0a%0aThe commands on this page assume your site is in a directory called "wiki/".  The test backup was made in December, 2005 so it's named accordingly.%0a%0aYour site will only have an uploads/ directory if uploads are enabled.%0a%0aThe backup command uses a date stamp (YYYYMM) in the filename.  If you automate the command via cron you'll wind up with monthly snapshots of your site.  You can get a daily snapshot by appending %25d to the date command ([@`date +%25Y%25m%25d`@] will get you YYYYMMDD).  Be wary of space limitations if you have a large uploads/ directory.%0a%0a%0a!!
