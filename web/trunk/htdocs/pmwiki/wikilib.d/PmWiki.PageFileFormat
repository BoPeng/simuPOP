text=You may have many documents that you would like to use a local program to format in a format PmWiki can display.%0a%0aYou could open each document and copy/paste the content to new pmwiki pages or you could format the document in advance and upload it using a FTP client.%0a%0aOnly two lines are necessary in a PmWiki page file:%0a%0a->[@%0aversion=pmwiki-2.1.0 urlencoded=1%0atext=Markup text%0a@]%0a%0aThe first line tells PmWiki that the values are urlencoded.  The actual value of the "version=" parameter doesn't matter, as long as "urlencoded=1" appears somewhere in the line.  The markup text needs to have newlines converted to "%250a" and percent signs converted to "%2525".%0a%0aKeys you could see in a raw PmWiki file:%0a%0a:'''version''': Version of PmWiki used to create the file %25comment%25 More???

Example:%0a%0a->[@%0aversion=pmwiki-2.1.0 ordered=1 urlencoded=1%0atext=This is a line.%250aThis is another.%0actime=1142030000%0a@]%0a%0a!! Keeping track of page history%0a%0aInside of a page file, PmWiki stores the latest version of the markup text, and uses this to render the page.  The page history is kept as a sequence of differences between the latest version of the page and each previous version.%0a%0aPmWiki normally puts the page history at the end of each page file in reverse chronological sequence, and sets the "ordered=1" items in the header.  If an operation needs only the most recent version of a page, then PmWiki will stop reading and processing a page file at the point where the history begins, potentially saving a lot of time and memory.  If the "ordered=1" flag isn't present, PmWiki makes no assumptions about the ordering of items in the pagefile and processes the entire file.%0a%0a%25trail%25 %3c%3c|[[Documentation Index]]|>>
