text=%3c%3c|[[PmWiki.Variables]]|>>%0a%0a:$EnableUpload:The upload.php script is automatically included from stdconfig.php if the $EnableUpload variable is true in config.php.  Note that one may still need to set an upload password before users can upload (see [[UploadsAdmin]]).%0a%0a:$UploadDir:The directory where uploads are to be stored.  Defaults to ''uploads/'' in the pmwiki directory, but can be set to any location on the server.  This directory must be writable by the webserver process if uploading is to occur.%0a%0a:$UploadUrlFmt:The url of the directory given by $UploadDir. %0a%0a$IMapLinkFmt['Attach:'] %0a->The format of the upload link displayed when an attachment is present. No default is set. %0a%0a:$LinkUploadCreateFmt: The format of the upload link displayed when an attachment not present.

Defaults to [@'/$Group'@] (uploads are organized per-group), but can be set to other values for sitewide or per-page attachments.%0a    $UploadPrefixFmt = '/$FullName';    # per-page attachments%0a    $UploadPrefixFmt = '';              # sitewide attachments%0a%0a:$EnableDirectDownload:When set to 1 (the default), links to attachments bypass PmWiki and come directly from the webserver.  Setting $EnableDirectDownload=0; causes requests for attachments to be obtained via [@?action=download@].  This allows PmWiki to protect attachments using a page's read permissions, but also increases the load on the server.%0a%0a:$EnableUploadVersions:When set to 1 (default is 0), uploading a file to a location where a file of the same name already exists causes the old version to be renamed to @@file.ext,timestamp@@ (instead of being overwritten). @@timestamp@@ is a Unix-style timestamp.%0a%0a:$UploadNameChars:The set of characters allowed in upload names.  Defaults to [@"-\w. "@], which means alphanumerics, hyphens, underscores, dots, and spaces can be used in upload names, and everything else will be stripped.%0a    $UploadNameChars = "-\w. !=+";    # allow exclamations, equals, and plus%0a%0a:$UploadMaxSize:Maximum size for uploading files (50000 octets by default)%0a%0a
