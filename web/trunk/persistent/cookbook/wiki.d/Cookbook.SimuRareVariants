Introduction%0a%0aThis script simulates the introduction and evolution of genetic variants in one or more ''regions'' of chromosomes. These regions span roughly 10k to 100k basepair and can be considered as a gene. During evolution, mutants are introduced to the population and change the fitness of individuals who carry these mutants. '''The most distinguishing feature of this script is that it allows random fitness effect to newly arising mutants'''. A multi-locus selection model is used to assign a fitness value to individuals according the mutants they carry.%0a%0aThe default demographic model consists of a long burn-in stage, a short bottleneck stage and a rapid population expansion stage. The burn-in stage of this demographic model evolves a relatively small population of 7900 individuals until it reaches a mutation selection equilibrium. After a short bottleneck stage, the population grows exponentially to a population of 900,000 individuals in 370 generations. This demographic model reflects a demographic model of the European population (Kryukov, et al., 2009). Other demographic models with constant population size, instant population expansion or multiple bottlenecks (Boyko, et al., 2008) can be specified easily. We use a diallelic mutation model that mutates alleles at a rate of 1.8x10-8 per generation per basepair. ""The default mutation model assumes that all mutations happen at different loci"" (recurrent mutations are ignored) so that the same mutants in the simulated population can be traced to a single mutation events. Another mutation model allows recurrent mutation. If a mutant is mutated, it will be mutated from allele 1 to 0.%0a%0aA random distribution is used to assign selection coefficients to newly arising mutations. This program incorporates multiple sets of selection parameters estimated from human genome data using different demographic models (Boyko, et al., 2008; Eyre-Walker, et al., 2006; Kryukov, et al., 2009; Williamson, et al., 2005).  For example, using a mixed gamma distribution, a mutant can have a selection coefficient of zeros (neutral alleles) or a random number drawn from a gamma distribution ranging from -0.00001 to -0.1 (Kryukov, et al., 2009). The overall fitness of an individual is determined by either a multiplicative, an additive, or an exponential model. The differences between these models are small when s_i are small.%0a%0aThe end result of this script include%0a%0a* A map file that contains the mutant location, frequency and selection coefficient. %0a* A mutant file that contains location of mutants of each individual.%0a* A simuPOP population that can be imported to simuPOP and analyzed.%0a%0a%25blue%25Note that fixed mutants are not counted as segregation sites but are included in the map and mutant files.%25%25%0a%0a!! Installation%0a%0aThis script requires simuPOP 1.0.4 to execute. Because simuPOP 1.0.4 has not been officially released, you can download a snapshot version of it from [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/simupop/files/ | the download page of simuPOP]]. If you have simuPOP 1.0.3, you can use [[Attach:simuRareVariants_1.0.3.py | a version that is written in 1.0.3]]. %25red%25This version is not actively maitained and is not recommended for serious simulations.%25%25.%0a%0aThe installation steps are described in detail in the simuPOP website. If you are using windows, please%0a* Download and install Python 2.6 from http://www.python.org.%0a* Download and install simuPOP 1.0.4 (or its snapshot version) from http://sourceforge.net/projects/simupop/files/%0a* Download one or more the following scripts.%0a->* %25red%25[[Attach:simuRareVariants.py|simuRareVariants.py]]%25%25 The main simulation script.%0a->* %25red%25[[Attach:simuRareVariants_1.0.3.py|simuRareVariants_1.0.3.py]]%25%25 An older version of this script that uses simuPOP 1.0.3. The usage of this script is different from simuRareVariants.py.%0a%0a%0a!! How to use this script%0a%0a!!! Graphical user interface%0a%0aThis script can be run from a graphical user interface.%0a%0aAttach:simuRareVariants.jpg%0a%0a%0a!!! Run from a command line in batch mode%0a%0aIf you need to run it in batch mode, you can use command line, using options such as%0a%0a->@@> simuRareVariants.py --gui=batch --selDist=gamma3@@%0a%0aDefault values will be used for unspecified parameters. %0a%0a!!! Import simuRareVariants from another script%0a%0aYou can import this script from another Python script and call its functions directly. Please see scripts in the examples section for details.%0a%0a!!! Complete list of options%0a%0aThis is the output of @@simuRareVariants.py -h@@%0a%0aSimulating a population of sequences forward in time, subject to mutation,%0anatural selection and population expansion. Because most mutants are introduced%0aduring the rapid population expansion, most of the alleles will be rare at the%0aend of the simulation. Samples simulated using this script can be used to study%0agenetic diseases caused by a large number of rare variants.%0a%0a%0ausage: simuRareVariants.py [-opt [arg] | --opt [=arg]] ...%0a%0aoptions:%0a  -h, --help%0a        Show this help message and exit.%0a%0a  --config=ARG (default: None)%0a        Load parameters from file ARG.%0a%0a  --optimized%0a        Run the script using an optimized simuPOP module.%0a%0a  --gui=[None|True|False|Tkinter|wxPython] (default: None)%0a        Which graphical toolkit to use.%0a%0a  --initPop=ARG  (default: '')%0a        Name of an initial population. If this file exists, it will be loaded%0a        and the evolution will start from this population, instead of a blank%0a        population. If this file does not exist, the initial population after%0a        the burnin stage will be saved to this file. This option is often used%0a        to reduce long burn-in generations for replicate simulations.%0a%0a  --regions=ARG  (default: ['chr1:1..50000'])%0a        A region (in basepair) means a piece of chromosome in which mutations%0a        can happen. A region should be expressed as chrXX:YYYY..ZZZZ where XX is%0a        chromosome number, YYYY is the starting position in basepair and ZZZZ is%0a        the ending position in basepair. The starting position should be at%0a        least one. If multiple regions are specified as a list of regions, they%0a        are assumed to be unlinked and will segregate independently even if they%0a        are on the same chromosome. Recombination within each region is not%0a        considered in this script because we assume that each region represents%0a        a narrow region of a chromosome that contains a gene.%0a%0a  --addMutantsFrom=ARG  (default: '')%0a        If a population is given, mutants from this population will be added to%0a        the population just before population expansion. Only loci that are%0a        within the specified regions will be selected. This population will be%0a        resized to bottleneck population size N1 before it is merged to the%0a        simulated population. This population is usually prepared using%0a        selectMarkers.py, using HapMap populations loaded using scripts%0a        loadHapMap2.py and loadHapMap3.py. These scripts are available from the%0a        simuPOP cookbook.%0a%0a  --addMutantsGen=ARG  (default: 0)%0a        Generation number at which mutants from an external population will be%0a        inserted to the evolving population.%0a%0a  --N=ARG  (default: [8100, 7900, 900000])%0a        The size of population at the end of each stage. We assume that the%0a        first stage is a burn-in stage with constant population size. For other%0a        stages, a bottleneck model (N1->N2 in one generation followed by a%0a        constant population size of N2) will be used for population shrinkage%0a        and an exponential population exponential model will be used for%0a        population expansion.%0a%0a  --numGen=ARG  (default: [5000, 10, 370])%0a        Numbers of generations of different stages.%0a%0a  --numStep=ARG  (default: [])%0a        Calculate and output statistics at intervals of specified number of%0a        generations. A single number or a list of numbers for each stage can be%0a        specified. If left unspecified, statistics at the beginning of each%0a        stage will be printed.%0a%0a  --mutationModel=ARG  (default: 'infinite_sites')%0a        Mutation model. The default mutation model is an infinite-site model in%0a        which mutations that happen at previously mutated loci, even if those%0a        mutants have got lost, will be ignored. This model makes sure that all%0a        mutants in the simulated population can be traced to a single mutation%0a        event. In a finite sites model, mutations at all loci are allowed. If a%0a        mutant is mutated, it will be mutated from allele 1 to allele 0. Because%0a        both recurrent and reverse mutations are allowed, the histories of%0a        mutants in the simulated populations are more difficult to trace. Note%0a        that if the region is reasonably wide and the mutation rate is%0a        reasonable small, very few mutants will hit the same locus so these two%0a        models will yield very similar results.%0a%0a  --mu=ARG  (default: 1.8e-08)%0a        Mutation rate%0a%0a  --selModel=ARG  (default: 'multiplicative')%0a        Multi-locus selection model, namely how to obtain an overall individual%0a        fitness after obtaining selection coefficients for all mutants (s_i, s_i%0a        %3c 0 when deleterious and s_i > 0 when adaptive). This script supports%0a        three models:%0a            multiplicative: prod (1 + s_i) Product of one minus selection%0a        coefficient.%0a            additive: max(0, 1 + sum(s_i)) One minus the sum of all selection%0a        coefficients.%0a            exponential: exp(sum(s_i)) Exponential of minus sum of all selection%0a        coefficients.%0a        Note that these models are equivalent if s_i are small and number of%0a        mutants are small.%0a%0a  --selDist=ARG  (default: 'constant')%0a        Distribution of selection coefficient for new mutants. This script%0a        currently support the following distributions:%0a        * constant: A single selection coefficient that gives each mutant a%0a        constant value s. The default parameter for this model is -0.005. You%0a        can set selCoef to 0 to simulate neutral cases.%0a        * gamma1: A basic gamma distribution (for -s) assuming a constant%0a        population size model (Eyre-Walker et al, 2006). The default parameters%0a        for this model is Pr(s=-x)=Gamma(0.23, 0.185).%0a        * gamma2: A gamma distribution (for -s) assuming a two-epoch population%0a        size change model (Eyre-Walker et al, 2006). The default parameters for%0a        this model is Pr(s=-x)=Gamma(0.28, 0.05).%0a        * gamma3: A gamma distribution (for -s) assuming a two-epoch population%0a        size change model for African population (Boyko et al, 2008). The%0a        default parameters for this model is Pr(s=-x)=Gamma(0.184, 0.160).%0a        * gamma4: A gamma distribution (for -s) assuming a complex bottleneck%0a        model for European population (Boyko et al, 2008). The default%0a        parameters for this model is Pr(s=-x)=Gamma(0.206, 0.146).%0a        * mixed_gamma: Parameter of this model should be a list of (a, p, k,%0a        theta) where a is the probability of having s=p (neutral or adptive%0a        sites), k, theta are the parameter of a gamma distribution Recomended%0a        parameter is (0.0186, 0.0001, 0.184, 0.160) for P(s=0.0001)=0.0186 and%0a        P(s=-x)=(1-0.0186)*Gamma(0.184,0.160).%0a        If you would like to define your own selection model, please have a look%0a        at class InfiniteSitesSelector. You can either modify function getGamma%0a        or define your own gammaFitness, getGamma and set self.func properly.%0a        NOTE:%0a        The mixed_gamma model is implemented as a user-defined Python function%0a        that return a random selection coefficient. You can define your own%0a        function to define arbitrary distribution of selection coefficients and%0a        pass this function to parameter selDist of function simuRareVariants()%0a        if you import this script and call function simuRareVariants directly.%0a        Furthermore, if this function has a parameter loc, the positions of the%0a        mutant will be passed to this function so that you can return site-%0a        specific coefficients.%0a%0a  --selCoef=ARG  (default: None)%0a        Selection coefficient with its meaning determined by parameter selDist.%0a        If None is given, the default parameter for the selected distribution%0a        will be used.%0a%0a  --popFile=ARG  (default: 'output.pop')%0a        Filename to which the simulated population will be saved in simuPOP%0a        format. The file can be loaded later for post processing purposes.%0a%0a  --markerFile=ARG  (default: 'output.map')%0a        Filename to which the marker information, including marker name%0a        (reg+index), chromosome, location, allele frequency and selection%0a        coefficient are saved. Monomorphic markers are ignored.%0a%0a  --mutantFile=ARG  (default: 'output.mut')%0a        Filename to which the mutants are outputed. The file will be saved in%0a        the format of%0a            ind_id mut1 mut2 ...%0a        where ind_id is the index of individual (1, 2, ...), mut1 and mut2 are%0a        locations of mutants. Haplotypes for different regions and homologous%0a        chromosomes are saved in different lines in the order of%0a          reg1_ploidy1%0a          reg1_ploidy2%0a          reg2_ploidy1%0a          reg2_ploidy2%0a          ...%0a%0a  --genotypeFile=ARG  (default: '')%0a        Filename to which the genotypes of all individuals are saved. The file%0a        will be saved in the format of%0a                famid id fa mo sex aff loc1_a1 loc1_a2 loc2_a1 loc2_a2 ...%0a        where famid is 1, 2, 3, ... id is always 1, fa, mo is always 0. Wildtype%0a        and mutant alleles are denoted by 0 and 1 respectively. This option is%0a        turned off by default because this format is not efficient in storing a%0a        small number of mutants.%0a%0a  --verbose=ARG  (default: 1)%0a        0 for quiet, 1 for regular output, 2 for debug output. In the debug%0a        output, a file 'mutations.lst' will be saved with all mutation events.%0a        This option is not visible from gui.%0a%0a%0a%0a!! Examples%0a%0a!!! Apply a penetrance or quantitative trait model%0a%0aThe selected population can be imported and post-processed using simuPOP. If you need to apply a quantitative trait model to the simulated population, you can use a function @@pyQuanTrait@@ using a user-defined function. The only difference is that 'alleles' in the simulated population are locations of mutants. Penetrance model can be assigned similarly. %0a%0aExample %25red%25[[Attach:quanTraits.py|quanTraits.py]]%25%25 demonstrates how to apply a quantitative trait model and draw samples with extreme trait values.%0a%0aExample %25red%25[[Attach:pedigree.py|pedigree.py]]%25%25 demonstrates how to evolve the simulated population for three more generations and draw three-generational pedigrees from the simulated multi-generational population, with restrictions on pedigree size and number of affected members.%0a%0aThese scripts import that calls the simuRareVariant function directly and uses functions defined in that script to save samples.%0a%0a!!! Arbitrary distribution of selection coefficients.%0a%0aThe graphical user interface allows you to perform simulations for fix types (constant, gamma and mixed gamma). If you would like to define you own distribution, you can define a function that returns selection coefficient according to your distribution and pass it to the simuRareVariants function of simuRareVariants.py. You might need to use simuPOP's random number generation functions listed in [[http://simupop.sourceforge.net/manual_release/build/refManual_ch2_sec5.html#class-rng | here]].%0a%0aExample %25red%25[[Attach:myDist.py|myDist.py]]%25%25 demonstrates how to define such a function.%0a%0a!!! Location-specific selection coefficients%0a%0aIf you would like to define a selection model with selection coefficients related to mutation location. You can add a parameter @@loc@@ to the distribution function. In that case, the location (in basepair) of the new mutant will be passed to your function. This feature allows you to define a neutral region within a larger region under selection, or return neutral for mutation happens at the last nucleotide of a condon. Moreover, if you have fixed set of selection coefficients, you can use this feature to pass them to the script.%0a%0aExample %25red%25[[Attach:locSpecific.py|locSpecific.py]]%25%25 demonstrates how to define a fitness function that returns location-specific fitness values.%0a%0a!!! Analyze all mutation events%0a%0aIf you would like to have a list of all mutation events happened during the evolutionary process, you can add @@--verbose=2@@ to the command line. This will generate a file named @@mutations.lst@@ which lists all mutations in the format of%0a%0a->@@generation  location  individual_index type@@%0a%0awhere type is 0 for forward mutation, 1 for backward mutation and 2 for ignored mutation in the infinite-site model. You can process this file to trace the age of all mutants.%0a%0a%0aExample %25red%25[[Attach:mutAge.py|mutAge.py]]%25%25 demonstrates how to process this file and calculate the age of all mutants.%0a%0a!! Extending simuRareVariants.py%0a%0a!!! Output more statistics such as the fitness value of everyone.%0a%0aThe default output of this script includes population size, number of segregation sites, average number of segregation sites per individual, average frequency of all mutants, average and mean fitness of individuals. You can modify the script to get more output. For example%0a%0a* You can use parameter @@output='>>output'@@ in operator @@pyOutput@@ to send the output to a file for future reference.%0a* You can use operator @@infoEval@@ with @@output='>>fitness.txt'"@@ to output fitness values for all individuals to a file.%0a%0aPlease refer to the simuPOP user's guide on how to use these parameters.%0a%0a

Introduction%0a%3c %0a%3c We use a demographic model that consists of a long burn-in stage, a short bottleneck stage and a rapid population expansion stage. The burn-in stage of a default demographic model evolves a relatively small population of 7900 individuals until it reaches a mutation selection equilibrium (QUESTION: neutral case?). After a short bottleneck stage, the population grows exponentially to a population of 900,000 individuals in 370 generations. This demographic model reflects a demographic model of the European population (Kryukov, et al., 2009), but it can also be used to simulate other demographic models with constant population size or instant population expansion (Boyko, et al., 2008). We use a diallelic mutation model that mutates alleles at a rate of 1.8x10-8 per generation per basepair. Although back mutations are allowed, their impact on the evolutionary process is negligible due to the relatively small number of mutants.%0a%3c %0a%3c A random distribution is used to assign selection coefficients to newly arising mutations. This program incorporates multiple sets of selection parameters estimated from human genome data using different demographic models (Boyko, et al., 2008; Eyre-Walker, et al., 2006; Kryukov, et al., 2009; Williamson, et al., 2005).  For example, using a mixed gamma distribution, a mutant can have a selection coefficient of zeros (neutral alleles) or a random number drawn from a gamma distribution ranging from -0.00001 to -0.1 (Kryukov, et al., 2009). The overall fitness of an individual is determined by either a multiplicative, an additive, or an exponential model. The differences between these models are small when s_i are small.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!! Installation%0a%3c %0a%3c This script needs simuPOP 1.0.4.
