text=(:title Welcome to simuPOP cookbook!:)%0a%0a!!! Purpose of this website%0a%0aThe simuPOP cookbook is an '''online collection of simuPOP examples, extensions, and evolutionary scenarios contributed by simuPOP users'''. It is also a repository of documents and examples that are complementary to the [[http://simupop.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/simupop/trunk/doc/userGuide.pdf | ''simuPOP user’s guide'']] and [[http://simupop.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/simupop/trunk/doc/refManual.pdf | ''reference manual'']].%0a%0aIf you are teaching a population genetics course, the simuPOP cookbook might have some examples to demonstrate basic population genetics models. If you would like to simulate a particular genetic effect such as a selective sweep but have no idea where to start, the simuPOP cookbook might have a few existing examples. To make this possible, %25blue%25'''please consider contributing to this cookbook if you have written some scripts that might benefit others'''%25%25.%0a%0a%0a%0a!!! Why is this cookbook password-protected?%0a%0aThe simuPOP cookbook is based on a [[http://www.pmwiki.org/ | wiki system]] so that everyone can contribute to it. However, allowing anyone to freely write to a wiki site has given wiki-spammers some business opportunities and wiki-administrators a lot of headaches. Because of these, the simuPOP cookbook is password-protected.%0a%0aIf you are not a spammer and have enough patience to read this paragraph, the password is written in this section in white.

How do I create/modify a recipe (wiki page)?%0a%0aThe simuPOP cookbook is based on %25newwin%25 [[http://www.pmwiki.org/ | pmwiki]]. Some basic editing rules will be given below the edit box when you edit a page.
