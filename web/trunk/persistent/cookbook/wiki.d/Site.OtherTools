Many such models are already incorporated into FREGENE, and since it is open source users can modify or extend these. Coalescent methods have difficulty incorporating large amounts of gene conversion or crossover (Hoggart et al. 2007), whereas these pose no particular problem for FREGENE.

Users can input their own sequences or tell the program to generate them. Retro and recurrent mutation can be allowed or neglected. A number of populations with any migration model can be defined. Each population consists of a number N of sequences or genomes. Bottlenecks and/or population expansion can be defined by the user during a desired number of generations. In addition, selective nucleotide sites undergoing directional selection could exist. Markovian mutation models (as GTR) are allowed, the same as GTR x MG94 codon models. In the 2-allele model, several chromosomes can compose each genome. Consequently, SNPs segregating independently or linked in the same chromosome can be studied. At each chromosome, constant or variable recombination (hotspots) can be considered. GenomePop manage both haploid and diploid genomes.

The core of simuPOP is a scripting language (Python) that provides a large number of objects and functions to manipulate populations, and a mechanism to evolve populations forward in time. Using this R/Splus-like environment, users can create, manipulate and evolve populations interactively, or write a script and run it as a batch file. Owing to its flexible and extensible design, simuPOP can simulate large and complex evolutionary processes with ease. At a more user-friendly level, simuPOP provides an increasing number of built-in scripts that perform simulations ranging from implementation of basic population genetics models to generating datasets under complex evolutionary scenarios. %0a---%0a> (:cell:) &nbsp;%0a24,27d23%0a%3c (:cellnr:) '''Platform'''%0a%3c (:cell:) All%0a%3c (:cellnr:) '''License'''%0a%3c (:cell:) GPL%0a

It allows for single SNP, as well as gene-gene interaction models to be associated with disease risk. genomeSIM utilizes two different methods to generate datasets. An initial population can be generated on the basis of allele frequencies of the SNPs and then further generations are created by crossing the members of successive generations. The simulator assigns affection status only after a specified number of generations. Alternatively, the simulator can construct a case-control dataset by generating individuals as above, assigning affection status, and selecting cases and controls until the dataset is complete.%0a---%0a> *[[http://chgr.mc.vanderbilt.edu/ritchielab/method.php?method=genomesim | genoSIM and genomeSIMLA]]%0a20d17%0a%3c ->FREGENE is a C++ program that simulates sequence-like data over large genomic regions in large diploid populations. Unlike coalescent-based simulation tools, such as MS (Hudson, 2002), FREGENE works forwards-in-time which allows a wide range of demographic and selection scenarios to be implemented. Many such models are already incorporated into FREGENE, and since it is open source users can modify or extend these. Coalescent methods have difficulty incorporating large amounts of gene conversion or crossover (Hoggart et al. 2007), whereas these pose no particular problem for FREGENE. FREGENE offers a flexible model for recombination hotspots, and can readily simulate regions up to tens of Mb on a standard desktop computer. %0a22d18%0a%3c ->Genomepop is flexible software that allows the forward simulation of DNA sequences in a metapopulation context under a variety of conditions. Users can input their own sequences or tell the program to generate them. Retro and recurrent mutation can be allowed or neglected. A number of populations with any migration model can be defined. Each population consists of a number N of sequences or genomes. Bottlenecks and/or population expansion can be defined by the user during a desired number of generations. In addition, selective nucleotide sites undergoing directional selection could exist. Markovian mutation models (as GTR) are allowed, the same as GTR x MG94 codon models. In the 2-allele model, several chromosomes can compose each genome. Consequently, SNPs segregating independently or linked in the same chromosome can be studied. At each chromosome, constant or variable recombination (hotspots) can be considered. GenomePop manage both haploid and diploid genomes. Several runs can be executed and a sample, of user-defined size, is obtained for each run and population.%0a

This is in contrast to coalescent population genetic simulation in which time, as represented within the simulation, proceeds back into the past.
