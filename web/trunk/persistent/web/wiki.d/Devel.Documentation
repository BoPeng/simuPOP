text=!! How the document of simuPOP is organized and distributed.%0a%0aThe whole ideas are that%0a# Documents are organized around their definitions, e.g. in source code for C++ functions and classes, in Python docstring for Python modules.%0a# Documents are extracted and converted to PDF and HTML formats.%0a# Examples are generated dynamically to make it easy to change examples, accomendate changes of simuPOP and check for errors.%0a%0a%0a!!!Examples in the user's guide%0a%0aExamples in the user's guide are all in file doc/userGuide.py. They are%0aseparated by directives such as%0a%0a    #begin_file log/standard.py%0a    #end_file%0a%0aTo generate source code and their log files (output as if they are executed%0ain an interactive Python session), you can run%0a%0a    > cd doc%0a    > ./runSampleScript.py userGuide.py%0a%0arunSampleScript.py will execute userGuide.py as if the examples are%0ainputted from a Python interactive shell. The examples will be written to%0afiles such as log/standard.py and the output will be written to files such%0aas log/standard.log. The log files, sometimes the the .py files, are%0ainserted into log/userGuide.lyx, and are converted to .PDF or .html format.%0aPieces of code that are included between #begin_ignore and #end_ignore will%0abe will be executed but not saved to output files. If there is any error%0ain the code, runSampleScript will stop and display the errors, unless a%0adirective #expect_error is included between #begin_file and #end_file,%0aindicating that the example is designed to generate some error.%0a%0aThe output files (log/*.py, log/*.log and sometimes log/*.png) are included%0ain doc/userGuide.lyx to generate both PDF and HTML versions of the simuPOP%0auser's guide.%0a%0a%0a%0a!!!Documentation of core simuPOP classes and functions (C++ level)%0a%0aIn order to reduce the workload to maintain different versions of%0adocumentation, all documents are in the source code, together with%0acorresponding function and class definitions. The documentation is written%0ain a format that is recognizable by 'doxygen', a document generator. For%0aexample, instead of using /* this is a C++ comment. */, user documentation%0ais written as /** this is documentation. */. Special format directives such%0aas \e (emph) and \c (fixed font) are used. \e is used for parameter name%0aand \c is used for functions.%0a%0aThe C++ level documentation is converted to XML format using command%0a%0a    > doxygen%0a%0aThe XML format of the documentation is read by a script and is written to%0adifferent formats. By executing%0a%0a    > tools/doxy2swig%0a%0aYou will get the following files:%0a%0a    1. src/simuPOP_doc.i%0a       This is a SWIG interface file with Python docstring for all C++%0a       level classes and functions. This file will be included by%0a       src/simuPOP_common.i to generate docstrings, which could be assessed%0a       by functions such as%0a%0a           >>> help(Population)%0a    %0a    2. doc/simuPOP_doc.tex%0a       This is a latex file with many definitions such as%0a       \loadPopulationRef. This file is included and used by%0a       doc/refManual.lyx to generate PDF documentations.%0a%0a    3. doc/build/*.ref%0a       These are function and class references in reStructuredText format.%0a       They are used by Sphinix to generate online HTML documentation.%0a%0a%0a!!!Documentation of Python modules%0a%0aFunctions and classes in simuPOP utility modules are written in%0areStructuredText format. This format is more or less human readable and is%0abecoming the recommended format for Python modules.%0a%0aScript doc/doxy2swig also scans Python modules and simuPOP interface file.%0aThe results are converted to doc/simuPOP_doc.tex and doc/build/*.ref for%0athe generation of PDF and HTML documentations. Note that doc/doxy2swig%0areads 'live' documents of simuPOP so you may need to run the whole process%0atwice to get the correct documentation becase of the chicken-egg problem%0aof documents.%0a%0a%0a!!!Generation of PDF documents%0a%0aThe PDF documents are prepared by LaTeX using a document processor LyX. You%0awill have to install lyx from http://www.lyx.org to view these files%0a(doc/userGuide.lyx and doc/refManual.lyx). These lyx files includes files%0adoc/simuPOP_doc.tex and many files under doc/log, which has to be prepared%0aas instructed before. If everything is ready, you could simply generate PDF%0aversion of the documents by running commands%0a%0a    > cd doc%0a    > make pdf%0a%0awhich calls lyx to convert .lyx to .pdf files.%0a%0a%0a!!!Generation of HTML documents%0a%0asimuPOP uses a converter to convert latex documents to reStructuredText and%0ause Sphinx (sphinx.pocoo.org) to convert reStructuredText to HTML. The%0aconverter could be checked out from svn.python.org but you will have to%0acustomize this conversion tool using a patch as follows:%0a%0a    > cd doc%0a    > svn co -r 76658 \%0a        http://svn.python.org/projects/doctools/converter/converter converter%0a    > cd converter%0a    > patch -p0 %3c ../converter_patch.diff%0a%0aUsing Python 2.6, you could generate HTML documents using%0a    > make html%0a%0aI have also added two other commands%0a    > make dist_svn%0a    > make dist_release  # for release%0a%0aso that you can upload the subversion or release version of the HTML%0adocuments to appropriate directories under http://simupop.sourceforge.net.%0aPDF versions of the documents should be checked in to the subversion%0arepository, and distributed with a simuPOP release.%0a%0aNOTE: public key could be set up through sourceforge.net/account/services%0aso that you do not have to enter password each time. This service is%0aprovided in the account service page of sourceforge.net (currently%0ahttps://sourceforge.net/account/services with a valid user account).%0a
