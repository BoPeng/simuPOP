Availability%0a%3c %0a%3c simuPOP is distributed under '''a GPL license'''. simuPOP is available on any platform where Python is available, and is currently tested under both 32 and 64 bit versions of Windows (Windows 2000 and later), Linux (Redhat), MacOS X and Sun Solaris systems. Different C++ compilers such as Microsoft Visual C++, gcc and Intel icc are supported under different operating systems. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!Download%0a%3c %0a55,60c49%0a%3c You may want to put these lines to your shell configuration file such as @@$HOME/.bashrc@@.%0a%3c %0a%3c !! Additional tools%0a%3c %0a%3c Thanks to the ‘glue language’ nature of Python, it is easy to inter-operate Python with other applications within a simuPOP script. For example, users can call any R function from Python/simuPOP for the purposes of visualization and statistical analysis, using R and a Python module RPy. This technique is widely used in simuPOP so it is highly recommended that you install R and rpy is your are familiar with R. In addition, although simuPOP uses the standard tkInter GUI toolkit when a graphical user interface is needed, it can make use of a wxPython toolkit if it is available. %0a%3c %0a---%0a> You may want to put these lines to your shell configuration file such as @@$HOME/.bashrc@@.%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
