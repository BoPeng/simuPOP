Major features%0a%0asimuPOP offers a long list of features, many of which are unique among all forward-time population genetics simulation programs. The most distinguished features include:%0a%0a# simuPOP provides '''three types of modules''' that use 1, 8 or 16 bits to store an allele. The binary module (1 bit) is suitable for simulating a large number of SNP markers and the long module (16 bits) is suitable for simulating some population genetics models such as the infinite allele mutation model. simuPOP supports different types of chromosomes such as autosome, sex chromosomes and mitochondrial, with arbitrary number of markers.%0a%0a# An arbitrary number of float numbers, called '''information fields''', can be attached to individuals of a population. For example, information field @@father_idx@@ and @@mother_idx@@ are used to track an individual’s parents, and @@pack_year@@ can be used to simulate an environmental factor associated with smoking.%0a%0a# simuPOP does not impose any limit on number of homologous sets of chromosomes, the size of the genome, or the number of individuals in a population. During an evolutionary process, a population can hold more than one most-recent generations. Pedigrees can be sampled from such '''multi-generation populations'''.%0a%0a# An operator can be native (implemented in C++) or hybrid (Python assisted). A '''hybrid operator''' calls a user-provided Python function to implement arbitrary genetic effects. For example, a hybrid mutator passes to-be-mutated alleles to a user-provided function and mutates these alleles according to the returned values.%0a%0a# simuPOP provides '''more than 70 operators''' that cover all important aspects of genetic studies. These include mutation (''k''-allele, stepwise, generalized stepwise and hybrid), migration (arbitrary, can create new subpopulation), recombination and gene conversion (uniform or nonuniform, sex-specific), quantitative trait (single, multilocus or hybrid), selection (single-locus, additive, multiplicative or hybrid multi-locus models), penetrance (single, multi-locus or hybrid), ascertainment (case–control, affected sibpairs, random, nuclear and large pedigree), statistics calculation (including but not limited to allele, genotype, haplotype, heterozygote number and frequency; expected heterozygosity; di-allelic and multi-allelic , and linkage disequilibrium measures), pedigree tracing, visualization (using [[http://www.r-project.org | R]] or other Python modules) and load/save in simuPOP’s native format and many external formats such as Linkage.%0a%0a# Mating schemes and many operators can work on '''virtual subpopulations''' of a subpopulation. For example, positive assortative mating can be implemented by mating individuals with similar properties such as ancestry. The number of offspring per mating event can be fixed, or can follow a statistical distribution.%0a%0a!!! Other forward-time simulation programs%0a%0aA number of forward-time simulation programs are available. If we exclude early forward-time simulation applications developed primarily for teaching purposes, notable forward-time simulation programs include [[http://www.unil.ch/dee/page36926_fr.html | easyPOP]], [[http://lifesci.rutgers.edu/~heylab/heylabsoftware.htm | FPG]], [[http://nemo2.sourceforge.net/ | Nemo]] and [[http://www2.unil.ch/popgen/softwares/quantinemo/ | quantiNemo]], [[http://chgr.mc.vanderbilt.edu/ritchielab/method.php?method=genomesim | genoSIM and genomeSIMLA]], [[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/projects/BARGEN/download/FREGEN/documentation_html.html | FreGene]], [[http://webs.uvigo.es/acraaj/GenomePop.htm | GenomePop]], [[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2323826 | ForwSim]], [[http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/btn317v1 | ForSim]], and [[http://sfscode.sourceforge.net | SFS_CODE]]. These programs are designed with specific applications and specific evolutionary scenarios in mind, and excel in what they are designed for. For some applications, these programs may be easier to use than simuPOP. For example, using a special look-ahead algorithm, ForwSim is among the fastest programs to simulate a standard Wright-Fisher process, and should be used if such a simulation is needed. However, these programs are not flexible enough to be applied to problems outside of their designed application area. For example, none of these programs can be used to study the evolution of a disease predisposing mutant, a process that is of great importance in statistical genetics and genetic epidemiology.%0a%0aCompared to such programs, simuPOP has the following advantages:%0a%0a* The '''scripting interface''' gives simuPOP the flexibility to create arbitrarily complex evolutionary scenarios. For example, it is easy to use simuPOP to explicitly introduce a disease predisposing mutant to an evolving population, trace the allele frequency of them, and restart the simulation if they got lost due to genetic drift.%0a%0a* The Python interface allows users to define '''customized genetic effects in Python'''. In contrast, other programs either do not allow customized effects or force users to modify code at a lower (e.g. C++) level.%0a%0a* simuPOP is the only application that embodies the concept of virtual subpopulation that allows '''evolutions at a finer scale'''. This is required for realistic simulations of complex evolutionary scenarios.%0a%0a* simuPOP allows users to '''examine an evolutionary process very closely''' because all simuPOP objects are Python objects that can be assessed using their member functions. For example, users can keep track of genotype at particular loci during evolution. In contrast, other programs work more or less like a black box where only limited types of statistics can be outputted.%0a%0a!!! Major drawback of simuPOP?%0a%0aThe scripting interface gives simuPOP the flexibility to simulate almost arbitrary evolutionary scenarios but it has also been frequently quoted as the major drawback of simuPOP because '''the scripting language interface has a steeper learning curve than the command line (or configuration file) interface of program A'''.%0a%0aWhile this claim is generally true, the comparison itself hardly makes sense. A fairer comparison would be comparing program A with a simuPOP script that simulates a similar evolutionary scenario. These scripts could be found at the [[http://simupop.sourceforge.net/cookbook | simuPOP online cookbook]]. They are usually quite user-friendly because they can get user inputs from command line arguments, a configuration file and a graphic user interface (using the @@simuOpt@@ module of simuPOP) and no knowledge in Python or simuPOP is required to run them.%0a%0a
