text=(:title What is simuPOP?:)%0a!! Introduction%0a%0asimuPOP is a '''general-purpose forward-time population genetics simulation environment'''. It is%0a%0a* A '''population genetics simulation''' program: simuPOP is an ''individual based'' population genetics simulation program. It explicitly models individuals with genotypes and simulates the transmission of individual genotype when a population evolves generation by generation. Although the basic evolutionary scenario follows a ''non-overlap generation'' model, aged structured populations can be mimicked using special non-random mating schemes.%0a%0a* '''Forward-time''':  Unlike coalescent-based programs, simuPOP evolves populations forward in time, subject to arbitrary number of genetic and environmental forces such as mutation, recombination, migration and population/subpopulation size changes. Statistics of populations can be calculated and visualized dynamically  which makes simuPOP an ideal tool to demonstrate population genetics models; generate datasets under various evolutionary settings, and more importantly, study complex evolutionary processes and evaluate gene mapping methods.%0a%0a* '''General-purpose''': Many population genetics simulation programs are available. However, they are all designed for specific types of evolutionary scenarios and are limited in their ability to simulate complex evolutionary processes. ''simuPOP'' is the only general-purpose simulation program that is capable of simulation arbitrarily complex evolutionary scenarios.%0a%0a* A '''simulation environment''': simuPOP is provided as a number of [[http://www.python.org | Python ]] modules, which provide of a large number of Python objects and functions, including population, mating schemes, operators (objects that manipulate populations) and simulators to coordinate the evolutionary processes. It is the users’ responsibility to write a Python script to glue these pieces together and form a simulation. At a more user-friendly level, simuPOP provides an increasing number of bundled scripts that perform simulations ranging from implementation of basic population genetics models to generating datasets under complex evolutionary scenarios. No knowledge about Python or simuPOP would be needed to run these simulations, if they happen to fit your need.%0a%0a!!
