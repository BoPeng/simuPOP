text=(:toc:)%0a%0aThis page lists release notes of all official simuPOP releases. If you would like to see what has been changed since the last official release, you can check the [[ http://simupop.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/simupop/trunk/ChangeLog | ChangeLog]] of the  [[http://simupop.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/simupop/trunk | development version of simuPOP]].%0a%0a!!! Release of simuPOP 1.0.5 (Nov. 22, 2010)%0aI am glad to release simuPOP 1.0.5, which is a maintenance release of%0athe 1.0.x series. Because this release fixes two crash bugs, all users%0aare recommended to upgrade.%0a%0aThe most useful feature of this release is the support of parameter%0asubPops in during mating operators. This feature can be used to apply%0adifferent during-mating operators to offspring according to their%0aproperties. For example, sex-specific selection can be implemented by%0aapplying different selection operators to virtual subpopulations%0adefined by individual sex; and applying an operator to a virtual%0asubpopulation with affected individuals will effectively discard all%0aunaffected individuals. An operator DiscardIf has been provided to%0afilter offspring according to subpopulations, an expression, or a%0auser-defined function. Please refer to simuPOP ChangeLog for a%0acomplete list of bug fixes and new features.%0a%0aWith the stabilization of the simuPOP interface, I will pay more%0aattention to the performance of simuPOP. Because many parts of simuPOP%0acan be parallelized, I plan to use openMP and other techniques to%0aimprove the efficiency of simuPOP. If your script has been running%0aslowly due to the use of some particular operators, please feel free%0ato let me know.%0a%0a%0a!!! Release of simuPOP 1.0.4 (Sep. 7, 2010)%0a%0aI am glad to announce the release simuPOP 1.0.4. This is a maintenance release of the simuPOP 1.x series. Except for minor adjustments to corner cases, this release is expected to be fully compatible with previous versions of simuPOP. Please report to the simuPOP mailinglist if your existing scripts fail to execute under this release. Because this release fixes a major bug in the simuPOP core, all users are recommended to upgrade. %0a%0aThe biggest change of this release is the support for Python 2.7 and 3.1. Because Python 3 is incompatible with the Python 2.x series, it has been challenging to make simuPOP compatible with both versions of Python. Although these changes are largely unseen to users, you will notice that all examples in the simuPOP user's guide are written in a style that is compatible with both versions of Python. For example, @@list(range(5))@@ is used instead of @@range(5)@@, and @@print(a)@@ is used instead of @@print a@@. Because @@print(a)@@ is interpreted as printing a tuple with a single element a, it yields the same results in both Python 2.x and Python 3.x. Unfortunately, because @@wxPython@@ and @@rpy@@ have not been ported to Python 3, features related to these two modules are not yet available. This basically means that you can not use wxPython-based parameter input dialog (the @@tkinter@@ version should be working well), and plotting operators in module @@simuPOP.plotter@@.%0a%0aThe simuOpt module has been revised to make it easier to use. For example, @@'type'@@ has been introduced to replace @@'allowedTypes'@@ so that you can use strings such as 'integers' to specify more complex types; @@'validator'@@ (renamed from @@'validate'@@) can now take expressions such as @@'len(par1) == len(par2)'@@ to perform cross-parameter validation; and 'name' have been used to replace @@'longarg'@@. In addition, a new @@'--gui=batch'@@ mode can be used to execute a script without specifying a large number of default parameters. Despite all these changes, your existing parameter specification dictionaries should still work as expected.%0a%0aAmong many new features, the ability to use subpopulation and virtual subpopulation name is most interesting. For example, you can now use @@subPops=[1, 'Male']@@ to specify a virtual subpopulation with name @@'Male'@@ (the first vsp defined by a @@SexSplitter@@). This feature should make your code more readable, and easier to maintain if you have a complex splitter with many VSPs.%0a%0aIn order to support simulation scenarios for specific applications, a new module @@simuPOP.sandbox@@ has been introduced. This module is intended to contain experimental functions and operators that might or might not be included in future versions of simuPOP. For example, if you have implemented a particular mating scheme for certain animal populations, it might be a good idea to add it to this module so that it can be distributed with simuPOP. Note that backward compatibility is not guaranteed for this module so scripts that make use of this module might be locked to a particular version of simuPOP.%0a%0a%0a!!! Release of simuPOP 1.0.3 (Jun. 8, 2010)%0a%0aI am happy to announce the release of simuPOP 1.0.3, which is a maintenance release with a number of small features. For example, a new option @@GLOBAL_SEQUENCE_OF_SEX@@ has been added to parameter @@sexMode@@ of parent choosers so that offspring sex can be controlled across families (e.g. same number of MALE and FEMALE individuals regardless of number of offspring produced at each mating scheme); A new parents chooser named @@CombinedParentsChooser@@ can now be used to combine the parents selected by two parent choosers; and a parameter @@size@@ can be used in @@simuOpt.valueListOf@@ to check the size of the input list. Please refer to the simuPOP ChangeLog for a complete list of new features.%0a%0aThe most useful feature, however, is that parameter @@loci@@ in all functions and operators now accepts loci names in addition to loci indexes. Because loci names will not be changed with the addition or removal of other loci, this feature makes it easy to locate loci in simulations where loci are added or removed dynamically, which is especially important for mating schemes or operators that are expected to be applied to populations with different numbers of loci. This feature was planned for a later version of simuPOP but a user request brought it to simuPOP 1.0.3. If you need any feature for your simulation, please do not hesitate to ask.%0a%0aEnjoy!%0a%0a!!! Release of simuPOP 1.0.2 (Apr. 1, 2010)%0a%0aI have just released simuPOP version 1.0.2. This is a maintenance release of simuPOP 1.0.1 with a few new features. The most useful feature is the addition of parameter haplotypes to operator InitGenotype, which allows initialization of individual genotypes by haplotypes. This release also reimplemented the way how random number of offspring (parameter numOffspring of mating schemes) is generated. Please check simuPOP change log for more information. %0a%0a!!! Release of simuPOP 1.0.1 (Feb. 24, 2010)%0a%0aI am happy to release simuPOP 1.0.1, which is a bug fixing release for simuPOP 1.0.0 with some new features for pedigree handling. Although none of the bugs is detrimental, it is recommended that all users upgrade to this release.%0a%0aThree member functions @@Pedigree.identifyAncestors@@, @@Pedigree.identifyOffspring@@ and @@Pedigree.save@@ have been added to the @@Pedigree@@ class. These functions identify all ancestors or offspring of a given set of individuals and can help you study the structure of a complete pedigree. Although a @@pedigree@@ object can be saved as a population object with all structural information, a new format has been introduced to save a pedigree in human readable format (similar to a .ped file used by many genetic analysis software). Because it can be troublesome to create a pedigree object with thousands of ancestral generations, the same file can be created using a @@PedigreeTagger@@ operator during evolution. This format can be loaded using a new global function @@loadPedigree@@.%0a%0aA pedigree object can now be used to direct the evolution of a population using a new mating scheme called @@PedigreeMating@@. This mating scheme takes a pedigree object and evolves a population according to the parental relationships saved in a pedigree object. This makes it possible to evolve a population using pre-determined pedigree structure. Potential applications include gene-dropping, a simulation technique that assign random genotypes to leaves of a pedigree and then ''dropping'' the genotypes to other individuals according to Mendelian laws.%0a%0aAmong other new features, the ability to use @@ALL_AVAIL@@ in the specification of virtual subpopulations is most interesting. For example, you can now use @@allIndividuals(subPops=[(ALL_AVAIL, 1)], ancGens=ALL_AVAIL)@@ to iterate through all females in a multi-generational population if a @@SexSplitter@@ is used, regardless of the number of subpopulations in the ancestral generations. Similarly, you can use @@stat(alleleFreq=0, subPops=[(1, ALL_AVAIL)])@@ to calculate allele frequencies in all virtual subpopulations. Please refer to the change log for a complete list of bug fixes and new features.%0a%0a%0a!!! Release of simuPOP 1.0.0 (Jan. 6th, 2010)%0a%0aAfter more than a year's hard work, I am happy to announce the release of simuPOP 1.0.0. This release marks the end of the tumultuous 0.9.x series and the beginning of the new 1.x.x development cycle when backward compatibility will be again enforced. All simuPOP users should upgrade to this release.%0a%0aDue to substantial changes to the simuPOP core and interface, this release is incompatible with previous versions of simuPOP. If you have been following the development of the 0.9.x series, this release introduces the following changes to the 0.9.9 release:%0a%0a1. In order to make simuPOP conform better to Python style guide and avoid potential confusion and misuse of simuPOP, I have renamed all global functions from CapWords style to mixedCases style, and class names from mixedCases to CapWords style. This has been a very difficult decision to make because it essentially changes all names of simuPOP.%0a%0a2. Parameter matingScheme has been moved from the Simulator() function to the Simulator.evolve() function, replacing the position of parameter duringOps. This change simplifies the use of during-mating operators because such operators now can only be used in the ops parameter of mating schemes.%0a%0a3. A new function Population.evolve() has been introduced to evolve a population directly. The role of simulators is therefore less important than before because you only need to use a simulator if you would like to simulate multiple populations simultaneously.%0a%0a4. As I have described in an earlier email to the mailing list, simuPOP now probes names of parameters of user-defined functions in order to determine what information it passes to these functions. This simplifies the use of user-defined functions because parameters such as pyOperator(offspringOnly) are no longer needed. A utility class WithArgs has been introduced to allow the use of arbitrary argument lists in user-defined functions.%0a%0aThere are many other small changes such as the removal of global function setRNG() (the same as getRNG().set()) and addition of function population.asPedigree (change a population to a pedigree object in place), pedigree.asPopulation (change a pedigree to a population object in place) and pedigree.identifyFamilies (separate a complete pedigree into to unrelated families). In addition, parameter ancGen has been replaced with ancGens in most functions with different usages. Please refer to the simuPOP user's guide and reference manual for details.%0a%0aFor users who have been using the 0.8.x series and waited patiently for the release of simuPOP 1.0, your wait is finally over. Compared to the last stable release 0.8.8, this release has substantially improved support for virtual subpopulations (VSP). For example, you can now migrate, select or mutate individuals, or calculate statistics differentially according to individual properties. This allows advanced features such as sex-biased migration, dynamic mutation rate and the calculation of statistics of arbitrary groups of individuals such as all individuals between age 20 and 40.%0a%0aIn order to handle pedigree structure in age-structured populations resulting from the simulation of overlapping generations, a new ID based pedigree tracking system (operators IdTagger and PedigreeTagger) has been introduced. These operators assign unique IDs to each individual and use them to track parental information during an evolutionary process. A new Pedigree class has been introduced to help you identify close and distant relatives of individuals and extract families from multi-generational or age-structured populations. All sampling functions have been rewritten and moved to a new module simuPOP.sampling.%0a%0aThis release also introduces numerous new features, including new operators ProductSplitter (define finer VSP from existing VSPs), InitInfo (initialize information fields), MitochondrialGenoTransmitter (a during mating operator to handle mitochondrial chromosomes), MatrixMutator (a mutation operator with arbitrary mutation matrix), MixedMutator (mixed mutation model), ContextMutator (a context-sensitive mutator), SummaryTagger (passing summary statistics from parents to offspring), new plotting operators such as ScatterPlotter, InfoPlotter, HistPlotter, QQPlotter and BoxPlotter to plot different types of plots during evolution, and new sampling functions such as drawCombinedSample to draw different types of samples (e.g. sibpairs and nuclear family) from the same population. Many details of existing functions and operators have also been changed. I have provided a quick migration guide in the ChangeLog section of the simuPOP homepage, which may help you convert your existing scripts to the latest release.%0a %0aPerhaps most importantly, this release comes with a comprehensive user's guide (213 pages, with 174 examples and 23 figures) and reference manual (94 pages) that accurately document all features of simuPOP. Although simuPOP has been relatively well documented in the past, this is the first time that all advanced features such as non-random and customized operators are properly documented. To avoid killing more trees to print these documents, I have created an online version of these documents which is more user-friendly because functions and classes in the user’s guide are readily linked to their references and you can download all examples. In addition, with the stabilization of the simuPOP interface, I invite you to post your functions and scripts to the simuPOP online cookbook so that others can benefit from your work.%0a%0a%0a %0a %0a!!! Release of simuPOP 0.9.9 -- the wait is almost over. (Dec. 10, 2009)%0a%0aAfter major revisions to the @@pedigree@@ class and the @@simuPOP.sampling@@ module, I am happy to announce the release of simuPOP 0.9.9. This release marks the completion of all new features and the 0.9.x release series. Because simuPOP 1.0 is right around the corner (I plan to release it within a month) and there are likely some interface adjustments, users are not recommended to upgrade to this release unless you are eager to test out the new sampling module.%0a%0aThe traditional index-based pedigrees have been replaced by a new ID based pedigree system. Because IDs are invariant across populations, the new system is much easier to work with. The resulting @@simuPOP.sampling@@ module is shorter, but more powerful than the previous one. New features include a combined sampler that allows you to draw different types of samples from a population, and a new @@subPops@@ parameter that allows you to drawn samples from selected virtual subpopulations, such as drawing cases and controls from certain age or ethnic groups. The population and pedigree classes have been modified to reflect this change, with improved @@population.removeSubPops@@, @@population.removeIndividuals@@, @@pedigree.locateRelatives@@, and new member functions @@population.removeInfoFields@@, @@population.extractSubPops@@, @@population.extractIndividuals@@ and @@pedigree.individualsWithRelatives@@. Please refer to the simuPOP user's guide and reference manual for more details about these new features.%0a%0aThere are two noticeable changes to the simuPOP user interface. First, parameters and population variables @@numOfMale@@ and @@numOfFemale@@ used in the @@stat@@ operator and some other places have been renamed to @@numOfMales@@ and @@numOfFemales@@ as suggested by a colleague. Second, all global constant variables such as @@ChromosomeX@@ and @@BinomialDistribution@@ have been changed to a @@CAPITAL_LETTER_WITH_UNDERSCORE@@ style. The previous style tends to be confusing because it is also used for global functions.%0a%0aIn addition, a new module simuPOP.gsl is added to simuPOP that exposes some GSL (GNU Scientific Libraries) CDF functions to the user interface. This module is provided for convenience and is in no means a complete wrapper of GSL. Because it is slow and error prone to import submodules such as @@simuPOP.plotter@@ because of their reliance on a third-party module rpy, submodules are no longer loaded by default with @@'from simuPOP import *'@@.%0a%0a%0a!!! Release of simuPOP 0.9.8 -- it is time to upgrade. (Oct, 29, 2009)%0a%0aI have just released simuPOP 0.9.8. With numerous enhancements in penetrance, quantitative trait and natural selection operators, all simuPOP operators have now been revisited, with full support for virtual subpopulations and complete documentation. Because version 0.9.9 will focus on pedigree and sampling related features, what you see now is pretty much the core for simuPOP 1.0. If you have been using simuPOP 0.8.8 for a relatively large project, you might want to wait for simuPOP 1.0. For all other users, it is highly recommended that you upgrade to this release. I cannot guarantee your script will work without modification under simuPOP 1.0, but this is a good time for you to test the new interface and propose any changes.%0a%0aThe biggest change you will notice is the removal of the stage feature of operators. Instead of specifying a stage for each operator, you now need to explicitly place your operators in parameters @@initOps@@, @@preOps@@, @@duringOps@@, @@postOps@@ and @@finalOps@@ of the @@simulator.evolve@@ function. To convert your script to the new version, you will need to change @@preOps@@ to @@initOps@@, @@postOps@@ to @@finalOps@@, and spread your operators in parameter @@ops@@ to parameters @@preOps@@, @@duringOps@@ and @@postOps@@ depending on which stage they are applied to the population.%0a%0aThis dramatic change aims to solve a long standing problem in simuPOP in that it is difficult to see at which stage and in which order operators in parameter ops will be applied during an evolutionary process. The original design gives each operator a default stage and allows you to change it if needed. However, it is not always clear what this default stage should be. For example, if you place a @@smmMutator@@ before a @@stat@@ operator using their default stages, the @@stat@@ operator will not collect statistics for a population after mutation happens. This is because @@smmMutator@@ is by default a pre-mating operator that applies to the parental generation, and a @@stat@@ is by default a post-mating operator that applies to the offspring generation. In the new version, you are required to put operators in one or more of parameters @@preOps@@, @@duringOps@@ and @@postOps@@ so it is clear at which stage and in which order operators are applied.%0a%0aThe new version enhances support for virtual subpopulations (VSP) and overlapping generations. A new virtual splitter @@productSplitter@@ is introduced that allows you to define VSPs such as male individuals between age 20 and 40. With a new parameter @@vspMap@@ in @@combinedSplitter@@, you can now combine several VSPs into one and define arbitrarily complex VSPs such as, quoting an user request, a mating VSP with males between age 20 and 40 and females between age 15 and 30. Although default names are given to VSPs, you can now give shorter names to VSPs using the names parameter of a splitter. In addition, the @@cloneGenoTransmitter@@ now copies all information fields from parents to offspring by default. This makes it much easier to use @@cloneMating@@ in overlapping generations. A new section has been added to the user's guide to describe how to use these features to simulate age structured populations and overlapping generations.%0a%0aAll penetrance, quantitative trait and selection operators have been revisited. The changes are too numerous to list here so please refer to the simuPOP documentation for details. The most interesting change is that simuPOP now allows natural selection through the selection of offspring, using absolute fitness values returned by a selector during the production of offspring. Although this is a slower way of doing natural selection in the standard random mating scheme, it can make a difference when you are using non-random mating or when you need to explicitly simulate the survival of offspring. %0a%0aThe use of demographic function has also been changed. Instead of passing subpopulation sizes to a demographic function such as @@demo_func(gen, oldSize)@@, the whole parental population is passed so you need to define you function as @@demo_func(gen, pop)@@. There are two reasons for this change. First, when there are virtual subpopulations, @@oldSize@@ might not be enough to determine subpopulation sizes of the offspring generation. Second, the new demographic function allows you to split and merge subpopulations in this function so the burden of demographic changes does not have to spread to a demographic function and operators such as @@splitSubPops@@ and @@mergeSubPops@@.%0a%0aAmong all new features, the new way to access individual information field is most useful. In addition to member functions @@individual.info@@ and @@individual.setInfo@@, you can now access information fields as attributes of individuals so that you can use @@ind.b = ind.a + 5@@ instead of the cumbersome @@ind.setInfo(ind.info('a') + 5, 'b')@@. I expect this to be used extensively in simulations that involve more than a few information fields.%0a%0a%0a!!! Release of simuPOP 0.9.7. (Sep, 26, 2009)%0asimuPOP takes another stride towards its 1.0 release when backward%0acompatibility will be enforced. Before that, you are seeing another%0aincompatible release that will likely break your existing script.%0aPlease be patient with me: all the changes are for the better and your%0asuffer is expected to be over in a few months. Although new users are%0aencouraged to use the latest release, existing users are not%0arecommended to upgrade unless you need to use some of the new features%0adescribed below. Note that the online documentation always reflects%0athe latest release.%0a%0aThe first major change is the reorganization of utility modules.%0aInstead of several separated modules, simuPOP is now organized as a%0apackage. Module @@simuUtil@@ is now @@simuPOP.utils@@, and @@simuRPy@@ is now%0a@@simuPOP.plotter@@. The @@simuOpt@@ module is kept out of simuPOP but the%0a@@simuOpt.simuOpt@@ class has been renamed to @@simuOpt.simuParam@@ due to%0apotential name conflicts. A completely rewritten set of classes and%0afunctions that simulate trajectories of allele frequencies have been%0aadded to @@simuPOP.utils@@. The new functions are more flexible and can%0ahandle complicated demographic and genetic features such as population%0asplit and merge, varying and population-specific selection pressures,%0aand gene gene interaction.%0a%0aAnother big change that will affect many existing scripts is the%0aseparation of @@initSex@@ from operators @@initByFreq@@ and @@initByValue@@. For%0athe sake of convenience, @@initByFreq@@ and @@initByValue@@ have always calls @@initSex@@ by%0adefault. This has lead to some errors when multiple initialization%0aoperators are used and some of them are sex-dependent. With the%0aintroduction of a new operator @@initInfo@@ that initializes individual%0ainformation fields, @@initSex@@ has been separated from these two%0aoperators. Consequently, @@initSex@@ now needs to be explicitly used%0awhenever @@randomMating@@ is used.%0a%0aAt a more advanced level, the way how during-mating operators are%0ahandled has been changed slightly. The concept of '''genotype%0atransmitter''' and related special handling of these operators have been%0aremoved. Consequently, all during-mating operators are handled%0aaccording to a simpler set of rules. The most visible change is that%0a@@recombinator@@ should now be used in the @@ops@@ parameter of a mating%0ascheme to replace the default genotype transmitter. The existing usage%0a(use it in @@simulator.evolve@@) is allowed, but will lead to reduced%0aperformance.%0a%0aThe tagging operators have been revisited in this release. New%0aoperators @@idTagger@@, @@summaryTagger@@ and @@pedigreeTagger@@ have been%0aintroduced, and the existing operators such as @@inheritTagger@@ have been%0aenhanced. The introduction of @@idTagger@@ allows you to give every%0aindividual in an evolving population an unique ID so that you can%0aeasily identify ancestors. A function @@population.indByID@@ has been%0aadded to look up an individual by its ID from a multi-generational%0apopulation. This feature is currently used to dump all recombination%0aevents, but will be used in all pedigree-related features (e.g.%0apedigree ascertainment) later on. Please check the use's guide for%0adetails.%0a%0aFinally, simuPOP now accepts locus-specific allele names. That is to%0asay, the same numeric alleles can corresponds to different alleles at%0adifferent loci. This feature is introduced so that simuPOP can better%0ahandle the HapMap and other genetic datasets that uses the same 0 and%0a1 coding for different nucleotides at different loci. Adding%0alocus-specific allele names make it easy, for example, to selected a%0asubset of loci from these datasets with losing their allele%0ainformation.%0a%0a%0a!!! Release of simuPOP 0.9.6. (Aug, 6, 2009)%0aThe stat operator is the biggest and most complicated operator of%0asimuPOP. There were some long-standing usage problems with this%0aoperator but the solutions were far from trivial. Only until last%0amonth did I gather some time and energy to rewrite this operator, and%0aI am happy that I did it because with the revision of this operator, I%0afinally see some light of the 1.0 release.%0a%0aThe first problem is with variable @@alleleFreq[loc][allele]@@ and other%0acounting and frequency variables. Because it is difficult to know in%0aadvance which alleles are in the population, @@alleleFreq[loc][allele]@@%0amight fail. Although I have forced alleleFreq[loc] to have at least%0atwo elements, which solves the problem for diallelic markers,%0a@@alleleFreq[loc][allele]@@ can be invalid in other modules. To address%0athis problem, I have added a special dictionary type @@defdict@@ to%0asimuPOP, which is now used for allele, genotype, haplotype and%0aheterozygote counts and frequencies. This dictionary returns 0 for%0aunrecognized keys so @@alleleFreq[loc][allele]@@ will return 0 if%0aspecified allele does not exist in a population. Because only existing%0aalleles are listed, @@alleleFreq[loc].keys()@@ lists available alleles and%0ayou can use @@len(alleleFreq[loc])@@ to get number of alleles at locus%0aloc. Because of this, statistic @@numOfAlleles@@ have been removed.%0a%0aThe second problem is how to control which variables to output and%0awhether or not to calculate statistics for all subpopulations.%0aParameters @@blah_param@@ (e.g. @@LD_param@@) have been used for each statistic but these%0aparameters were difficult to use. The new stat operator now has a @@vars@@%0aparameter that allows you to specify which variables to output, and%0ause special variable names (e.g. @@alleleFreq_sp@@) to control whether or%0anot statistics should be calculated for all subpopulations. An%0aadditional parameter @@suffix@@ has been introduced to allow for change of%0avariable names.%0a%0aThe new stat operator now supports parameter @@subPops@@ so that you can%0acalculate statistics for specified (virtual) subpopulations. This%0amakes it easy to calculate partial statistics such as pairwise Fst.%0aMore importantly, the use of virtual subpopulations allows you to%0acalculate, for example, allele frequency among cases and controls, and%0aassociation tests among only smokers.%0a%0aOther than these, there has been several new statistics such as%0a@@sumOfInfo@@, @@meanOfInfo@@, @@varOfInfo@@, @@minOfInfo@@, @@maxOfInfo@@ for the%0acalculation of basic statistics of specified information fields, new%0agenotype based genetic association tests (Chi-square and Armitage%0atrend test), and new statistics for population structure (Nei's Gst).%0aPerhaps more importantly, all statistics of the stat operator has now%0abeen carefully documented with examples. Please check the relevant sections of the [[http://simupop.sourceforge.net/manual/build/4_userGuide.html#statistics-calculation-operator-stat | user's guide]] and [[http://simupop.sourceforge.net/manual/build/3_refManual.html#stat | reference manual]] for details.%0a%0a%0a%0aThere have been other interface changes. If your scripts use functions%0a@@rng()@@, @@population.ancestor()@@, nested lists for parameters @@lociPos@@ and%0a@@lociNames@@ of function population, and parameter rep of operators,%0aplease check the ChangeLog or updated user's guide because these%0afunctions and parameters have been changed.%0a%0a!!! Release of simuPOP 0.9.5. (Jun, 22, 2009)%0a%0a%0aI am glad to announce the release of simuPOP 0.9.5. This release is%0amarked by significant improvements in mutation operators. Many new%0amutators have been added with new features introduced to existing%0amutators. For example:%0a# Mutators can now be applied to virtual subpopulations (e.g. sex different mutation rates)%0a# A new matrixMutator that mutates alleles according to a mutation rate matrix.%0a# Specialized mutators for diallelic and nucleotide loci (snpMutator and acgtMutator).%0a# New mixedMutator that can apply multiple mutators with certain probabilities.%0a# New contextMutator that can apply different mutators according to the context of mutated allele.%0a# A new map in and map out feature that allows the use of mutation models when interpretation of alleles differs.%0a%0aThe interface of several existing mutators have also been changed. For%0aexample, the maxAllele parameter of a kamMutator is changed to k (with%0aa different meaning), and the generalized stepwise mutation model has%0abeen merged to smmMutator. Please refer to the updated simuPOP user's%0aguide (http://simupop.sourceforge.net/manual/build/4_userGuide.html#mutation)%0afor details.%0a%0aThere has been a few other style changes. For example, the preOps and%0aops parameters of simulator::evolve now accept single-form inputs%0a(ignore [] when there is only one operator). In addition, parameter%0arate of the recombinator has been renamed to rates because this%0aparameter accepts multiple recombination rates. This change is%0aexpected to break a lot of scripts. Please change your scripts%0aaccordingly.%0a%0a!!! Release of simuPOP 0.9.4. (May, 20, 2009)%0a%0avarPlotter in simuRPy.py has always been the most complex Python operator in simuPOP. It has a class hierarchy of five classes that handle different types of figures. A large number of parameters are provided to customize many features of your figures. As a result, this operator has been a nightmare to test and maintain. I could not even document it properly because I was not sure which combination of parameters were supposed to work.%0a%0aI am glad to report that varPlotter and the whole simuRPy module have been rewritten. Instead of providing a giant class that provides many features, the new simuRPy module provides four operators: '''varPlotter''', '''scatterPlotter''', '''infoPlotter''' (with '''histPlotter''' and '''qqPlotter''' as two special cases) and '''boxPlotter'''. These operators are small in size but are very powerful in the sense that you can customize every aspect of your figures using derived keyword parameters.%0a%0aA derived keyword parameter is a parameter that%0a# Can be prefixed with a R function name to be passed to a specific R function. For example, @@par_mar=[1,2,2,2]@@ will pass @@mar=[1,2,2,2]@@ to R function @@par@@.%0a# Can be suffixed with an iterator name to pass different values to different replicate, subpopulation, etc. For example, @@lty_rep=[1, 2, 3]@@ will pass @@lty=1@@, @@lty=2@@, @@lty=3@@ to replicate 1, 2, and 3.%0a# Can accept an expression as its value. For example, @@plot_main='!"Freq at gen %25d"@@ @@%25 gen'@@ will pass @@main="Freq at gen 10"@@ at generation 10.%0a%0aUtilization of such a mechanism greatly simplifies the implementation of these operators, and on the other hand allows arbitrary parameters to be passed to the underlying R functions. Please visit http://simupop.sourceforge.net/manual/build/5_userGuide.html#simurpy for detailed explanations and a few examples.%0a%0aEnjoy!%0a%0a%0a!!! Release of simuPOP 0.9.3. (Apr. 3, 2009)%0a%0aI have just released the 0.9.3 version of simuPOP. This version fixes a number of bugs, including the memory leak problem with operator infoExec and infoEval. A few minor features are added to this version, most notably the ability to direct your operator output to any Python function. An example has been given in the updated user's guide. %0a%0aProgress has also been made to the simuPOP documentation. All genotype transmitters are now properly documented. A few more examples are added to the online cookbook, including a function to save simuPOP population in popGene format. This makes Yaji Xu, author of this function, the first simuPOP user who contributes to the online cookbook. Thanks!%0a%0a!!! Release of simuPOP 0.9.2. (Feb 20, 2009)%0a%0aAs I have announced before, the development of the 0.9.x series will not consider backward compatibility. This is again the case for today's 0.9.2 release. Briefly speaking, the following areas have been revisited, revised, and documented:%0a%0aOperators:%0a%0a* Initializers: @@initSex@@, @@initByFreq@@, and @@initByValue@@. No significant change.%0a* Expression and statements: @@pyOutput@@, @@pyEval@@, @@pyExec@@, @@infoEval@@, @@infoExec@@. Minor interface changes. @@infoEval@@ can no longer change individual information field.%0a* Demographic models:%0a** @@migrator@@: Change interface, add support for virtual subpopulation, add @@mode=ByIndInfo@@%0a** @@pyMigrator@@: Removed because its functionality can now be achieved by the @@ByIndInfo@@ mode of a migrator.%0a** @@splitSubPops@@: Renamed from @@splitSubPop@@. Add support for multiple subpopulations and the ability to split by information field.%0a** @@resizeSubPops@@: Add support for resize by proportions.%0a* Miscellaneous operators: Polish and add examples for @@dumper@@, @@savePopulation@@, @@setAncestralDepth@@, @@ifElse@@, @@pause@@, @@turnOnDebug@@, @@turnOffDebug@@ and @@ticToc@@.%0a%0aUtility module:%0a%0a* revise how module @@simuOpt@@ handles environmental variables and commandline options. The biggest change is the replacement of @@--noDialig@@ by @@--gui=False@@ where @@-gui@@ can take other values. This option also affects other functions that use a GUI.%0a* revise @@simuOpt.setOptions@@ which takes parameters @@gui@@ and @@revision@@. Function @@requiredRev@@ is removed.%0a* rewrite function @@simuOpt.getParam@@ and make it a class @@simuOpt.simuOpt@@. More specifically, if you have%0a%0a%0a--> [@%0apar = simuOpt.getParam(options)%0aif len(par) == 0:%0a   sys.exit(0)%0a%0a# unpack parameters%0a(help, v1, v2, v3) = par%0a%0aif help:%0a    print simuOpt.usage(par, options)%0a%0a# run simulation%0asimulate(v1, v2, v3)%0a@]%0a%0a->You should remove @@--help@@ from @@options@@ (@@-h@@ and @@--help@@ are now handled automatically) and use%0a%0a--> [@%0apar = simuOpt.simuOpt(options)%0a%0aif not par.getParam():%0a   sys.exit(0)%0a%0a# unpack parameters%0av1, v2, v3 = par.asList()%0asimulate(v1, v2, v3)%0a# or simply use parameters as attributes of the simuOpt object.%0asimulate(par.v1, par.v2, par.v3)%0a# or change your interface to pass the simuOpt object directly, which%0a# is easier to use if there are a large number of parameters.%0asimulate(par)%0a@]%0a%0aWebsite:%0a%0a* All documentations are available online at [[http://simupop.sourceforge.net/manual]].%0a* A wiki-based simuPOP online cookbook is available now at [[http://simupop.sourceforge.net/cookbook]]. All recipes that were distributed with simuPOP are moved to this website.%0a%0aThere are many more small changes. Please refer to [[http://simupop.sourceforge.net/manual/build/userGuide.html | user's guide]] and [[http://simupop.sourceforge.net/manual/build/refManual.html | reference manual]] for details.%0a%0a%0a!!!simuPOP 0.9.1 has been released today. (Jan 13, 2009)%0a%0a%0aThe first thing you need to know: this version is incompatible with previous simuPOP versions! Although the overall structure and most features are unchanged, your existing script will most likely not work without modification.%0a%0aThe second thing you need to know: although most dramatic changes have already been made, the following simuPOP versions may not be compatible with this version. Although population, simulator and mating schemes can be considered stable, operators and utility modules will be under revision. The situation will continue until simuPOP 1.0 is released. Backward compatibility will be kept again from that version. Despite of the inconveniences, you may want to take the opportunity to express your concern about simuPOP during this time because changes will be much more difficult to incorporate after simuPOP 1.0 is released.%0a%0aThe conclusion: If you are happy with simuPOP 0.8.8, keep using it. If you are learning simuPOP, or if you are starting a new project, it might be a good idea to jump in this version.%0a%0aThere has been major interface changes and some core changes during the past few months. Many functions and parameters have been renamed, combined, or removed. During this process, I have rewritten the simuPOP reference manual and user's guide. If you are not sure what have been changed, the simuPOP user's guide is now your best source of information. The operator part of this document is not finished yet, but it already has 70+ examples that demonstrate all the features of simuPOP. In addition, the simuPOP reference manual now has accurate information about every functions for population, virtual subpopulations, simulator and mating schemes.%0a%0aVersion 0.9.1 introduces two new features: support for customized chromosome types such as human mitochondrial chromosomes and support for customized genotype transmitters for mating schemes. These are quite advanced features so I will not describe them here. Please refer to relevant sections in the simuPOP user's guide if you are interested.%0a%0a%0aThere are numerous interface changes. Most important ones include:%0a%0aPopulation:%0a%0a* Rename population::savePopulation to save. Remove parameters compress and format.%0a* Support customized chromosome types.%0a* Rename arrGenotype to genotype, add setGenotype.%0a* setIndInfo and indInfo now support virtual subpopulations.%0a* Many other member functions have been adjusted.%0a%0aOperator:%0a%0a* Combine parameter output and outputExpr in operators, the latter is now specified as output='!expr'.%0a* Remove parameter grp.%0a* Allow parameter rep to accept a list of replicates.%0a* Add parameter subPops so that (some) operators can be applied to a list of (virtual) subpopulations.%0a* Add initSex() operator, remove pyInit(). Add parameter initSex to operators initByFreq and initByValue.%0a* Remove all locus=blah shortcut for loci=[blah], allow parameter loci to take both forms of input.%0a* Remove operator pyIndOperator() and some taggers.%0a* Move case control sampler and affected sibpair sampler to the Python level. largePedigreeSample and nuclearFamilySample are temporarily unavailable.%0a* Remove indRange parameter in initializer and dumper, add subPops as a list of (virtual) subpopulations.%0a%0aMating schemes:%0a%0a* Combine parameters newSubPopSize, newSubPopFunc to subPopSize, which can accept both types of parameters.%0a* Combine numOffspring, mode and numOffspringParam to numOffspring, which now accept a tuple-like input.%0a* Combine sexMode and sexParam to sexMode, which now accepts a tuple-like input.%0a* Rename pyMating to homoMating.%0a* Separate during-mating operators used in mating schemes as genotype transmitters.%0a* Allow specification of per-mating scheme during mating operators.%0a* Move all pre-defined homogeneous mating schemes to the Python level.%0a%0aSimulator:%0a%0a* Replace parameter 'end' to 'gen' in simulator::evolve.%0a* Remove the group feature and the step function.%0a* Add simulator::populations().%0a%0aExternal modules:%0a* Many functions in simuUtil are removed. They will be added later, perhaps in different form.%0a* simuOpt is unchanged.%0a* new features in simuRPy.%0a* hapMapUtil will be removed later.%0a%0aBundled scripts:%0a* They are not working yet. They will be adapted to the new interface later.%0a%0aI sincerely apologize for any inconvenience these changes may cause. I will do my best to help you modify your existing scripts if you send your questions to this list.%0a%0a%0a!!! Release of version 0.8.8 (Oct 25, 2008)%0a%0aI am pleased to announce the release of simuPOP 0.8.8.%0aThis is a maintenance release without the introduction%0aof any new feature. On the contrary, it removes several %0ararely used features and adjusts the interface of several %0afunctions. For example, all arrBlah() functions are now %0amarked obsolete. These functions can be used now, but will be %0aremoved when simuPOP 1.0 is released.%0a%0aDue to the change of interface, current simuPOP users are%0anot encouraged to upgrade.%0a%0a!!! Release of version 0.8.7 (Aug, 29, 2008)%0a%0aDear simuPOP users,%0a%0aI am glad to announce the release of simuPOP 0.8.7. This %0arelease fixes a few bugs found by a simuPOP user, and a %0along-lasting bug that prevents windows users from saving%0asimuPOP files in gzip compressed format.%0a%0aThe biggest change of this release is the drop of support%0afor binary and XML formats. They were provided for historic%0areasons but do not stand a place in simuPOP after the %0awindows/gzip bug is fixed. simuPOP files saved in these%0aobsolete formats can still be loaded. Because simuPOP now%0asupport only one file format, file extension is no longer%0aimportant. The recommended extensions are now .pop for%0apopulations and .sim for simulators.%0a%0aDue to the seriousness of a migration related bug, all %0asimuPOP users are recommended to upgrade.%0a%0a!!! Release of simuPOP 0.8.6 (Jun 20, 2008)%0a%0aDear simuPOP users,%0a%0aAfter more than two months' intensive work, simuPOP 0.8.6 %0ais finally released today. This release fixes a number of %0abugs and introduces a few important features so I strongly %0asuggest that all simuPOP users to upgrade.%0a%0aSix bugs are fixed in this release. They range from minor %0amemory management problems to incorrect interplay between %0aancestral generation, information fields and migration. An %0aupgrade is recommended because these bugs may lead to %0aincorrect output for complicated simulation scenarios that %0ainvolve migration and information fields.%0a%0aA number of new features are added to simuPOP. For example, %0amigrator now supports migration out of virtual %0asubpopulations. An obvious application of this feature is %0ato migrate mostly or only males from a population. Two new %0aoperators resizeSubPop amd initSex are introduced. The %0alatter was separated from other initializers such as %0ainitFreq and is used when you only need to initialize sex.%0a%0aThe virtual subpopulation interface has been changed a %0alittle bit. More specifically, there is now no %0asubpopulation-specific virtual subpopulations. If different %0avirtual subpopulations are desired for different %0asubpopulations, a combined virtual splitter should be used. %0aThis change is likely to break your current scripts that %0ause virtual subpopulation but changes to your scripts %0ashould be straightforward.%0a%0aCurrent development of simuPOP has been focusing on easy %0ahandling of pedigrees. Although simuPOP allows the %0aevolution of multi-generation population and provides %0amethods to record and access pedigree information, locating %0arelatives other than direct parents have been difficult. In %0athis release, two functions are provided to locate and %0atrace arbitrary relative information from a multi-%0ageneration population. An infoParentsChooser is provided to %0amate between individuals and individuals whose indexes are %0aspecified in some information fields. A new consanguineousMating %0amating scheme is provided as a shortcut for %0ainfoParentsChooser and mendelianOffspringGenerator. %0aInterested users should have a look at a new example %0adoc/cookbook/Mating_consanguineous.py. Note that these %0afeatures should be considered experimental. The whole %0ainterface may change when it stabilizes in the 0.8.7 %0arelease cycle.%0a%0aThere are many other small improvements such as the %0aaddition of individual::intInfo(), population::ancestor(), %0aand the polish of tk parameter input dialog. Please refer %0ato  ChangeLog for details.%0a%0aEnjoy!%0a%0a!!! Version 0.8.5 is released (Apr. 3, 2008)%0a%0asimuPOP 0.8.5 is released today. The previous versions of %0asimuPOP has provided a flexible framework to define %0aarbitrary nonrandom mating schemes. Despite the power of %0athis framework, users have found it unconvenient to %0aconstruct commonly used nonrandom mating schemes each time %0afrom scratch. Therefore, I have added a bunch of nonrandom %0amating schemes such as homogamy (using homogamousMating), %0apolygyny and polyandry (using polygamousMating), random %0amating with alpha individuals (using alphaMating), and %0ahaplodiploid mating.%0a%0a%0aThe last mating scheme requires native support of %0ahaplodiploid populations in the simuPOP core. Starting from %0athis version, you can specify ploidy=Haplodiploid when you %0acreate a population. Recombinator acts differently in such a%0a population by copying the first copy of paternal %0achromosomes directly to an offspring.%0a%0a%0aThis version also addresses an concern of why %0asimulator::evolve() has to specify ending generation, %0ainstead of how many generations to evolve. A new parameter%0a gen is introduced, and the use of the old parameter end is %0adepreciated (working but with a warning message).%0a%0a%0a!!! Release of simuPOP 0.8.4 (Mar, 8, 2008)%0a%0aI am glad to announce the release of simuPOP 0.8.4. This %0arelease fixes a few bugs in the new mating schemes introduced%0ain 0.8.2 and 0.8.3, and adds a few new features such as%0aa combined splitter, operators infoEval and infoExec.%0aA few examples of nonrandom mating schemes are added%0ato the doc/cookbook directory. They will be explained%0ain detail in an upcoming simuPOP cookbook.%0a%0aUsers of advanced mating schemes are highly recommended %0ato upgrade.%0a%0a!!! Release of simuPOP 0.8.3 (Jan 17, 2008)%0a%0aI am glad to announce the release of simuPOP 0.8.3. This%0aversion continues to improve non-random mating by adding %0apedigree tracing and handling capacities. For example, using %0aparentTagger, one can now save the pedigree of the whole %0aevolution, and replay the pedigree using a new pedigreeMating %0amating scheme. By creating a pedigree manually, it is easy to %0aimplement a gene-dropping algorithm using simuPOP.%0a%0aFunctions in hapMapUtil.py are also updated when I use them for more hapMap-related simulations.%0a%0a!!! Release of simuPOP 0.8.2 (Nov, 19, 2007)%0a%0aEvery major release of simuPOP introduces a major feature to%0asimuPOP. For the 0.8.x series, simuPOP is making great %0aprogresses in the simulation of heterogeneous populations.%0aThis is achieved by the introduction of virtual %0asubpopulations, and more flexible mating schemes. Operators%0aare expected to work with virtual subpopulations soon.%0a%0aA 'virtual subpopulation' refers to any groups of individuals,%0adefined by a 'virtual splitter'. For example, all males,%0aall affected individuals, or all individuals having an %0ainformation field age with value 5 can form a virtual%0asubpopulation. In contrast to subpopulations, virtual%0asubpopulations are dynamic because individual properties%0aare variable.%0a%0aBy setting virtual splitters to subpopulations, various%0aoperations can now be performed on specific virtual%0asubpopulations. For example, it is now easy to calculate LD%0abetween affected individuals, or individuals with any %0aother specific property. Future versions of simuPOP would %0aallow heterogeneous mutation, recombination etc on different%0avirtual subpopulations.%0a%0aIn this release, the mating schemes are reorganized%0ato allow heterogeneous mating schemes. Two important%0aconcepts: parents chooser and offspring generator%0aare introduced. Different parent choosers and offspring%0agenerators can be combined freely to form arbitrary%0amating schemes. Moreover, different mating schemes%0acan be applied to different subpopulation, even virtual%0asubpopulations. For example, it is now possible to %0aapply selfing to, e.g. 20%25 of the parents, and random mating%0ato the rest of the parents. Using hybrid parents%0achoosers, it is possible to implement aged population and%0anon-random mating schemes that consider, for example,%0ageographic information.%0a%0aHybrid mating schemes tend to be slow because a parents%0achooser will be called repeatedly. If the algorithm of%0apicking parents is complicated, it is recommended to%0aimplement this algorithm in C++. I have included a sample %0ascript scripts/demoNonRandomMating.py to demonstrate%0ahow to do this.%0a%0aPlease refer to the relevant section of the user's%0aguide and reference manual for details about virtual%0asubpopulations, various virtual splitters, new mating %0aschemes like selfMating, pyMating and heteroMating, and %0avarous parents choosers and offspring generators.%0aAlthough a lot of testing has been done, and the performance%0apenalty of the new features has been kept minimal, normal%0ausers are not recommended to upgrade. I expect the new%0afeatures to become mature in the 0.8.x release cycle.%0a%0a%0a!!! Release of simuPOP 0.8.1 (Oct 05, 2007)%0a%0aI am glad to announce the release of simuPOP 0.8.1. This is%0aa regular maintenance release with a few bug fixes and%0aimprovements. The first major new feature is that %0ainformation fields can now be passed to pyPenetrance %0aand pySelector operators, which allows easy simulations%0aof environmental factors. In addiiton, chromNames parameter%0ais added to the constructoe of population so that chromosome%0anames can be tracked with function chromNames(), chromName()%0aand chromByName() functions.%0a%0a!!! Release of simuPOP 0.8.0 (Aug 4, 2007)%0a%0aI am glad to announce the release of simuPOP 0.8.0, the %0aresult of more than one year's hard work since the release %0aof simuPOP 0.7.0.%0a%0aThis release contains numerous new features, optimization %0aand bug fixes that greatly improve the use of information %0afields, binary modules, and the usability of simuPOP. Most %0aimportantly, with the help from a graduate research %0aassistant, the online help system and simuPOP reference %0amanual have been overhauled. I strongly encourage all%0asimuPOP users to upgrade.%0a%0a

Because Python 3 is incompatible with the Python 2.x series, it has been challenging to make simuPOP compatible with both versions of Python. Although these changes are largely unseen to users, you will notice that all examples in the simuPOP user's guide are written in a style that is compatible with both versions of Python. For example, @@list(range(5))@@ is used instead of @@range(5)@@, and @@print(a)@@ is used instead of @@print a@@. Because @@print(a)@@ is interpreted as printing a tuple with a single element a, it yields the same results in both Python 2.x and Python 3.x. Unfortunately, because @@wxPython@@ and @@rpy@@ have not been ported to Python 3, features related to these two modules are not yet available.

In addition, a new @@'--gui=batch'@@ mode can be used to execute a script without specifying a large number of default parameters. Despite all these changes, your existing parameter specification dictionaries should still work as expected.%0a%3c %0a%3c Among many new features, the ability to use subpopulation and virtual subpopulation name is most interesting.

This feature should make your code more readable, and easier to maintain if you have a complex splitter with many VSPs.%0a%3c %0a%3c In order to support simulation scenarios for specific applications, a new module @@simuPOP.sandbox@@ has been introduced.

Although these changes are largely unseen to users, you will notice that all examples in the simuPOP user's guide are written in a style that is compatible with both versions of Python. For example, list(range(5)) is used instead of range(5), and print(a) is used instead of print a. Because print(a) is interpreted as printing a tuple with a single element a, it yields the same results in both Python 2.x and Python 3.x. Unfortunately, because wxPython and rpy have not been ported to Python 3, features related to these two modules are not yet available. This basically means that you can not use wxPython-based parameter input dialog (the tkinter version should be working well), and plotting operators in module simuPOP.plotter.%0a%3c %0a%3c The simuOpt module has been revised to make it easier to use. For example, 'type' has been introduced to replace 'allowedTypes' so that you can use strings such as 'integers' to specify more complex types; 'validator' (renamed from 'validate') can now take expressions such as 'len(par1) == len(par2)' to perform cross-parameter validation; and 'name' have been used to replace 'longarg'. In addition, a new '--gui=batch' mode can be used to execute a script without specifying a large number of default parameters. Despite all these changes, your existing parameter specification dictionaries should still work as expected.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> !!!

This module is intended to contain experimental functions and operators that might or might not be included in future versions of simuPOP. For example, if you have implemented a particular mating scheme for certain animal populations, it might be a good idea to add it to this module so that it can be distributed with simuPOP. Note that backward compatibility is not guaranteed for this module so scripts that make use of this module might be locked to a particular version of simuPOP.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a

Release of simuPOP 1.0.3 (Jun. 8, 2010)%0a%3c %0a%3c I am happy to announce the release of simuPOP 1.0.3, which is a maintenance release with a number of small features. For example, a new option @@GLOBAL_SEQUENCE_OF_SEX@@ has been added to parameter @@sexMode@@ of parent choosers so that offspring sex can be controlled across families (e.g. same number of MALE and FEMALE individuals regardless of number of offspring produced at each mating scheme); A new parents chooser named @@CombinedParentsChooser@@ can now be used to combine the parents selected by two parent choosers; and a parameter @@size@@ can be used in @@simuOpt.valueListOf@@ to check the size of the input list. Please refer to the simuPOP ChangeLog for a complete list of new features.%0a%3c %0a%3c The most useful feature, however, is that parameter @@loci@@ in all functions and operators now accepts loci names in addition to loci indexes. Because loci names will not be changed with the addition or removal of other loci, this feature makes it easy to locate loci in simulations where loci are added or removed dynamically, which is especially important for mating schemes or operators that are expected to be applied to populations with different numbers of loci. This feature was planned for a later version of simuPOP but a user request brought it to simuPOP 1.0.3. If you need any feature for your simulation, please do not hesitate to ask.%0a%3c %0a%3c Enjoy!%0a%3c %0a

Release of simuPOP 1.0.1 (Feb. 24, 2010)%0a%3c %0a%3c I am happy to release simuPOP 1.0.1, which is a bug fixing release for simuPOP 1.0.0 with some new features for pedigree handling. Although none of the bugs is detrimental, it is recommended that all users upgrade to this release.%0a%3c %0a%3c Three member functions @@Pedigree.identifyAncestors@@, @@Pedigree.identifyOffspring@@ and @@Pedigree.save@@ have been added to the @@Pedigree@@ class. These functions identify all ancestors or offspring of a given set of individuals and can help you study the structure of a complete pedigree. Although a @@pedigree@@ object can be saved as a population object with all structural information, a new format has been introduced to save a pedigree in human readable format (similar to a .ped file used by many genetic analysis software). Because it can be troublesome to create a pedigree object with thousands of ancestral generations, the same file can be created using a @@PedigreeTagger@@ operator during evolution. This format can be loaded using a new global function @@loadPedigree@@.%0a%3c %0a%3c A pedigree object can now be used to direct the evolution of a population using a new mating scheme called @@PedigreeMating@@. This mating scheme takes a pedigree object and evolves a population according to the parental relationships saved in a pedigree object. This makes it possible to evolve a population using pre-determined pedigree structure. Potential applications include gene-dropping, a simulation technique that assign random genotypes to leaves of a pedigree and then ''dropping'' the genotypes to other individuals according to Mendelian laws.%0a%3c %0a%3c Among other new features, the ability to use @@ALL_AVAIL@@ in the specification of virtual subpopulations is most interesting. For example, you can now use @@allIndividuals(subPops=[(ALL_AVAIL, 1)], ancGens=ALL_AVAIL)@@ to iterate through all females in a multi-generational population if a @@SexSplitter@@ is used, regardless of the number of subpopulations in the ancestral generations. Similarly, you can use @@stat(alleleFreq=0, subPops=[(1, ALL_AVAIL)])@@ to calculate allele frequencies in all virtual subpopulations.

Compared to the last stable release 0.8.8, this release has substantially improved support for virtual subpopulations (VSP). For example, you can now migrate, select or mutate individuals, or calculate statistics differentially according to individual properties. This allows advanced features such as sex-biased migration, dynamic mutation rate and the calculation of statistics of arbitrary groups of individuals such as all individuals between age 20 and 40.%0a%3c %0a%3c In order to handle pedigree structure in age-structured populations resulting from the simulation of overlapping generations, a new ID based pedigree tracking system (operators IdTagger and PedigreeTagger) has been introduced. These operators assign unique IDs to each individual and use them to track parental information during an evolutionary process. A new Pedigree class has been introduced to help you identify close and distant relatives of individuals and extract families from multi-generational or age-structured populations. All sampling functions have been rewritten and moved to a new module simuPOP.sampling.%0a%3c %0a%3c This release also introduces numerous new features, including new operators ProductSplitter (define finer VSP from existing VSPs), InitInfo (initialize information fields), MitochondrialGenoTransmitter (a during mating operator to handle mitochondrial chromosomes), MatrixMutator (a mutation operator with arbitrary mutation matrix), MixedMutator (mixed mutation model), ContextMutator (a context-sensitive mutator), SummaryTagger (passing summary statistics from parents to offspring), new plotting operators such as ScatterPlotter, InfoPlotter, HistPlotter, QQPlotter and BoxPlotter to plot different types of plots during evolution, and new sampling functions such as drawCombinedSample to draw different types of samples (e.g. sibpairs and nuclear family) from the same population.

Instead of specifying a stage for each operator, you now need to explicitly place your operators in parameters @@initOps@@, @@preOps@@, @@duringOps@@, @@postOps@@ and @@finalOps@@ of the @@simulator.evolve@@ function. To convert your script to the new version, you will need to change @@preOps@@ to @@initOps@@, @@postOps@@ to @@finalOps@@, and spread your operators in parameter @@ops@@ to parameters @@preOps@@, @@duringOps@@ and @@postOps@@ depending on which stage they are applied to the population.%0a%3c %0a%3c This dramatic change aims to solve a long standing problem in simuPOP in that it is difficult to see at which stage and in which order operators in parameter ops will be applied during an evolutionary process. The original design gives each operator a default stage and allows you to change it if needed. However, it is not always clear what this default stage should be. For example, if you place a @@smmMutator@@ before a @@stat@@ operator using their default stages, the @@stat@@ operator will not collect statistics for a population after mutation happens. This is because @@smmMutator@@ is by default a pre-mating operator that applies to the parental generation, and a @@stat@@ is by default a post-mating operator that applies to the offspring generation. In the new version, you are required to put operators in one or more of parameters @@preOps@@, @@duringOps@@ and @@postOps@@ so it is clear at which stage and in which order operators are applied.%0a%3c %0a%3c The new version enhances support for virtual subpopulations (VSP) and overlapping generations. A new virtual splitter @@productSplitter@@ is introduced that allows you to define VSPs such as male individuals between age 20 and 40. With a new parameter @@vspMap@@ in @@combinedSplitter@@, you can now combine several VSPs into one and define arbitrarily complex VSPs such as, quoting an user request, a mating VSP with males between age 20 and 40 and females between age 15 and 30. Although default names are given to VSPs, you can now give shorter names to VSPs using the names parameter of a splitter. In addition, the @@cloneGenoTransmitter@@ now copies all information fields from parents to offspring by default. This makes it much easier to use @@cloneMating@@ in overlapping generations.

With a new parameter vspMap in combinedSplitter, you can now combine several VSPs into one and define arbitrarily complex VSPs such as, quoting an user request, a mating VSP with males between age 20 and 40 and females between age 15 and 30. Although default names are given to VSPs, you can now give shorter names to VSPs using the names parameter of a splitter. In addition, the cloneGenoTransmitter now copies all information fields from parents to offspring by default. This makes it much easier to use cloneMating in overlapping generations. A new section has been added to the user's guide to describe how to use these features to simulate age structured populations and overlapping generations.%0a> %0a17,21c17,22%0a%3c The use of demographic function has also been changed. Instead of passing subpopulation sizes to a demographic function such as @@demo_func(gen, oldSize)@@, the whole parental population is passed so you need to define you function as @@demo_func(gen, pop)@@. There are two reasons for this change. First, when there are virtual subpopulations, @@oldSize@@ might not be enough to determine subpopulation sizes of the offspring generation. Second, the new demographic function allows you to split and merge subpopulations in this function so the burden of demographic changes does not have to spread to a demographic function and in several operators.%0a%3c %0a%3c Among all new features, the new way to access individual information field is most useful. In addition to member functions @@individual.info@@ and @@individual.setInfo@@, you can now access information fields as attributes of individuals so that you can use @@ind.b = ind.a + 5@@ instead of the cumbersome @@ind.setInfo(ind.info('a') + 5, 'b')@@.

The original design gives each operator a default stage and allow you to change it if needed. However, it is not always clear what this default stage should be. For example, if you place a mutator before a stat operator using their default stages, the stat operator will not collect statistics for a population after mutation happens. This is because mutator is by default a pre-mating operator that applies to the parental generation, and a stat is by default a post-mating operator that applies to the offspring generation.

The changes are too numerous to list here so please refer to the simuPOP documentation for details. The most interesting change is that simuPOP now allows natural selection through the selection of offspring, using absolute fitness values returned by a selector during the production of offspring. Although this is a slower way of doing natural selection in the standard random mating scheme, it can make a difference when you are using non-random mating or when you need to explicitly simulate the survival of offspring. %0a%3c %0a%3c The use of demographic function has also been changed.

Before that, you are seeing another%0a%3c incompatible release that will likely break your existing script.%0a%3c Please be patient with me: all the changes are for the better and your%0a%3c suffer is expected to be over in a few months. Although new users are%0a%3c encouraged to use the latest release, existing users are not%0a%3c recommended to upgrade unless you need to use some of the new features%0a%3c described below. Note that the online documentation always reflects%0a%3c the latest release.%0a%3c %0a%3c The first major change is the reorganization of utility modules.%0a%3c Instead of several separated modules, simuPOP is now organized as a%0a%3c package. Module @@simuUtil@@ is now @@simuPOP.utils@@, and @@simuRPy@@ is now%0a%3c @@simuPOP.plotter@@. The @@simuOpt@@ module is kept out of simuPOP but the%0a%3c @@simuOpt.simuOpt@@ class has been renamed to @@simuOpt.simuParam@@ due to%0a%3c potential name conflicts. A completely rewritten set of classes and%0a%3c functions that simulate trajectories of allele frequencies have been%0a%3c added to @@simuPOP.utils@@. The new functions are more flexible and can%0a%3c handle complicated demographic and genetic features such as population%0a%3c split and merge, varying and population-specific selection pressures,%0a%3c and gene gene interaction.%0a%3c %0a%3c Another big change that will affect many existing scripts is the%0a%3c separation of @@initSex@@ from operators @@initByFreq@@ and @@initByValue@@. For%0a%3c the sake of convenience, @@initByFreq@@ and @@initByValue@@ have always calls @@initSex@@ by%0a%3c default. This has lead to some errors when multiple initialization%0a%3c operators are used and some of them are sex-dependent. With the%0a%3c introduction of a new operator @@initInfo@@ that initializes individual%0a%3c information fields, @@initSex@@ has been separated from these two%0a%3c operators. Consequently, @@initSex@@ now needs to be explicitly used%0a%3c whenever @@randomMating@@ is used.%0a%3c %0a%3c At a more advanced level, the way how during-mating operators are%0a%3c handled has been changed slightly. The concept of '''genotype%0a%3c transmitter''' and related special handling of these operators have been%0a%3c removed. Consequently, all during-mating operators are handled%0a%3c according to a simpler set of rules. The most visible change is that%0a%3c @@recombinator@@ should now be used in the @@ops@@ parameter of a mating%0a%3c scheme to replace the default genotype transmitter. The existing usage%0a%3c (use it in @@simulator.evolve@@) is allowed, but will lead to reduced%0a%3c performance.%0a%3c %0a%3c The tagging operators have been revisited in this release. New%0a%3c operators @@idTagger@@, @@summaryTagger@@ and @@pedigreeTagger@@ have been%0a%3c introduced, and the existing operators such as @@inheritTagger@@ have been%0a%3c enhanced. The introduction of @@idTagger@@ allows you to give every%0a%3c individual in an evolving population an unique ID so that you can%0a%3c easily identify ancestors. A function @@population.indByID@@ has been%0a%3c added to look up an individual by its ID from a multi-generational%0a%3c population. This feature is currently used to dump all recombination%0a%3c events, but will be used in all pedigree-related features (e.g.%0a%3c pedigree ascertainment) later on. Please check the use's guide for%0a%3c details.%0a%3c %0a%3c Finally, simuPOP now accepts locus-specific allele names. That is to%0a%3c say, the same numeric alleles can corresponds to different alleles at%0a%3c different loci. This feature is introduced so that simuPOP can better%0a%3c handle the HapMap and other genetic datasets that uses the same 0 and%0a%3c 1 coding for different nucleotides at different loci. Adding%0a%3c locus-specific allele names make it easy, for example, to selected a%0a%3c subset of loci from these datasets with losing their allele%0a%3c information.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> Due to the incompatible way simuPOP is currently progressing, your existing script might not run due to the following changes:%0a> * @@initSex()@@ is now separated from @@initByFreq@@ and @@initByValue@@. That is to say, an explicit @@initSex()@@ is always needed to use @@randomMating@@.%0a> * Module @@simuUtil@@ is now a submodule @@simuPOP.utils@@.%0a> * Module @@simuRPy@@ is now a submodule @@simuPOP.plotter@@.%0a> * class @@simuOpt.simuOpt@@ is renamed to @@simuOpt.simuParam@@ due to potential name conflict.%0a> * Parameter ops of a mating scheme now must accept a full list of during-mating operators because this parameter now replaces, instead of appends to, the default genotype transmitter.%0a> %0a> Most new features are around taggers. There are two new tagging operators @@idTagger@@ and @@summaryTagger@@, and the existing taggers have been revised. The introduction of @@idTagger@@ allows you to give every individual in an evolving population an unique ID so that you can easily identify ancestors.

(Sep, 26, 2009)%0a%3c Due to the incompatible way simuPOP is currently progressing, you existing script might not run due to the following changes:%0a%3c * @@initSex()@@ is now separated from @@initByFreq@@ and @@initByValue@@.

There are two new tagging operators @@idTagger@@ and @@summaryTagger@@, and the existing taggers have been revised. Please check the use's guide for details. Additional features include an operator @@initInfo@@, and a function @@population.indByID@@ to locate an individual from its ID. Finally, this version of simuPOP introduces locus-specific allele names which makes it easier to work with datasets (such as the HapMap dataset) that use the same 0, 1 coding for different alleles.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a

diff:1249674017:1249665204:=6,60c6,22%0a%3c The stat operator is the biggest and most complicated operator of%0a%3c simuPOP. There were some long-standing usage problems with this%0a%3c operator but the solutions were far from trivial. Only until last%0a%3c month did I gather some time and energy to rewrite this operator, and%0a%3c I am happy that I did it because with the revision of this operator, I%0a%3c finally see some light of the 1.0 release.%0a%3c %0a%3c The first problem is with variable alleleFreq[loc][allele] and other%0a%3c counting and frequency variables. Because it is difficult to know in%0a%3c advance which alleles are in the population, alleleFreq[loc][allele]%0a%3c might fail. Although I have forced alleleFreq[loc] to have at least%0a%3c two elements, which solves the problem for diallelic markers,%0a%3c alleleFreq[loc][allele] can be invalid in other modules. To address%0a%3c this problem, I have added a special dictionary type defdict to%0a%3c simuPOP, which is now used for allele, genotype, haplotype and%0a%3c heterozygote counts are frequencies. This dictionary returns 0 for%0a%3c unrecognized keys so alleleFreq[loc][allele] will return 0 if%0a%3c specified allele does not exist in a population. Because only existing%0a%3c alleles are listed, alleleFreq[loc].keys() lists available alleles and%0a%3c you can use len(alleleFreq[loc]) to get number of alleles at locus%0a%3c loc. For this reason, statistic numOfAlleles have been removed.%0a%3c %0a%3c The second problem is how to control which variables to output and%0a%3c whether or not to calculate statistics for all subpopulations.%0a%3c Parameters blah_param have been used for each statistic but these%0a%3c parameters were difficult to use. The new stat operator now has a vars%0a%3c parameter that allows you to specify which variables to output, and%0a%3c use special variable names (e.g. alleleFreq_sp) to control whether or%0a%3c not statistics should be calculated for all subpopulations. An%0a%3c additional parameter suffix has been introduced to allow for change of%0a%3c variable names.%0a%3c %0a%3c The new stat operator now supports parameter subPops so that you can%0a%3c calculate statistics for specified (virtual) subpopulations. This%0a%3c makes it easy to calculate partial statistics such as pairwise Fst.%0a%3c More importantly, the use of virtual subpopulations allows you to%0a%3c calculate, for example, allele frequency among cases and controls, and%0a%3c association tests among only smokers.%0a%3c %0a%3c Other than these, there has been several new statistics such as%0a%3c sumOfInfo, meanOfInfo, varOfInfo, minOfInfo, maxOfInfo for the%0a%3c calculation of basic statistics of specified information fields, new%0a%3c genotype based genetic association tests (Chi-square and Armitage%0a%3c trend test), and new statistics for population structure (Nei's Gst).%0a%3c Perhaps more importantly, all statistics of the stat operator has now%0a%3c been carefully documented with examples. Please check the relevant sections of the [[http://simupop.sourceforge.net/manual/build/4_userGuide.html#statistics-calculation-operator-stat | user's guide]] and [[http://simupop.sourceforge.net/manual/build/3_refManual.html#stat | reference manual]] for details.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c There have been other interface changes. If your scripts use functions%0a%3c rng(), population.ancestor(), nested lists for parameters lociPos and%0a%3c lociNames of function population, and parameter rep of operators,%0a%3c please check the ChangeLog or updated user's guide because these%0a%3c functions and parameters have been changed.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> %0a> If your scripts use functions @@rng()@@, @@population.ancestor()@@, nested lists for parameters @@lociPos@@ and @@lociNames@@ of function population, and parameter @@rep@@ of operators, please check the ChangeLog or updated user's guide because these functions and parameters have been changed.%0a> %0a> Then, your @@stat@@ operator probably will not work because this operator has been rewritten with many changes and new features:%0a> %0a> * Statistic @@numOfAlleles@@ is removed.%0a> * New statistic @@sumOfInfo@@, @@meanOfInfo@@, @@varOfInfo@@, @@minOfInfo@@, @@maxOfInfo@@ for the calculation of basic statistics of specified information fields.%0a> * New genotype based gentic association tests (Chi-square and Armitage trend test).%0a> * New statistics for population structure (Nei's Gst).

Many new%0a%3c mutators have been added with new features introduced to existing%0a%3c mutators. For example:%0a%3c # Mutators can now be applied to virtual subpopulations (e.g. sex different mutation rates)%0a%3c # A new matrixMutator that mutates alleles according to a mutation rate matrix.%0a%3c # Specialized mutators for diallelic and nucleotide loci (snpMutator and acgtMutator).%0a%3c # New mixedMutator that can apply multiple mutators with certain probabilities.%0a%3c # New contextMutator that can apply different mutators according to the context of mutated allele.%0a%3c # A new map in and map out feature that allows the use of mutation models when interpretation of alleles differs.%0a%3c %0a%3c The interface of several existing mutators have also been changed.

These operators are small in size but are very powerful in the sense that you can customize every aspect of your figures using derived keyword parameters.%0a%3c %0a%3c A derived keyword parameter is a parameter that%0a%3c 1.

Can be suffixed with an iterator name to pass different values to different replicate, subpopulation, etc. For example, @@lty_rep=[1, 2, 3]@@ will pass @@lty=1@@, @@lty=2@@, @@lty=3@@ to replicate 1, 2, and 3.%0a%3c 3. Can accept an expression as its value. For example, @@plot_main='!"Freq at gen %25d" %25 gen'@@ will pass @@main="Freq at gen 10"@@ at generation 10.%0a%3c %0a%3c Using such a mechanism, the new operators can focus on the logics %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a> I am glad to report that varPlotter and the whole simuRPy module have been rewritten.

Release of simuPOP 0.8.6 (Jun 20, 2008)%0a%3c %0a%3c Dear simuPOP users,%0a%3c %0a%3c After more than two months' intensive work, simuPOP 0.8.6 %0a%3c is finally released today. This release fixes a number of %0a%3c bugs and introduces a few important features so I strongly %0a%3c suggest that all simuPOP users to upgrade.%0a%3c %0a%3c Six bugs are fixed in this release. They range from minor %0a%3c memory management problems to incorrect interplay between %0a%3c ancestral generation, information fields and migration. An %0a%3c upgrade is recommended because these bugs may lead to %0a%3c incorrect output for complicated simulation scenarios that %0a%3c involve migration and information fields.%0a%3c %0a%3c A number of new features are added to simuPOP. For example, %0a%3c migrator now supports migration out of virtual %0a%3c subpopulations. An obvious application of this feature is %0a%3c to migrate mostly or only males from a population. Two new %0a%3c operators resizeSubPop amd initSex are introduced. The %0a%3c latter was separated from other initializers such as %0a%3c initFreq and is used when you only need to initialize sex.%0a%3c %0a%3c The virtual subpopulation interface has been changed a %0a%3c little bit. More specifically, there is now no %0a%3c subpopulation-specific virtual subpopulations. If different %0a%3c virtual subpopulations are desired for different %0a%3c subpopulations, a combined virtual splitter should be used. %0a%3c This change is likely to break your current scripts that %0a%3c use virtual subpopulation but changes to your scripts %0a%3c should be straightforward.%0a%3c %0a%3c Current development of simuPOP has been focusing on easy %0a%3c handling of pedigrees. Although simuPOP allows the %0a%3c evolution of multi-generation population and provides %0a%3c methods to record and access pedigree information, locating %0a%3c relatives other than direct parents have been difficult. In %0a%3c this release, two functions are provided to locate and %0a%3c trace arbitrary relative information from a multi-%0a%3c generation population. An infoParentsChooser is provided to %0a%3c mate between individuals and individuals whose indexes are %0a%3c specified in some information fields. A new consanguineousMating %0a%3c mating scheme is provided as a shortcut for %0a%3c infoParentsChooser and mendelianOffspringGenerator. %0a%3c Interested users should have a look at a new example %0a%3c doc/cookbook/Mating_consanguineous.py. Note that these %0a%3c features should be considered experimental. The whole %0a%3c interface may change when it stabilizes in the 0.8.7 %0a%3c release cycle.%0a%3c %0a%3c There are many other small improvements such as the %0a%3c addition of individual::intInfo(), population::ancestor(), %0a%3c and the polish of tk parameter input dialog. Please refer %0a%3c to  ChangeLog for details.%0a%3c %0a%3c Enjoy!%0a%3c %0a%3c !!! Version 0.8.5 is released (Apr. 3, 2008)%0a%3c %0a%3c simuPOP 0.8.5 is released today. The previous versions of %0a%3c simuPOP has provided a flexible framework to define %0a%3c arbitrary nonrandom mating schemes. Despite the power of %0a%3c this framework, users have found it unconvenient to %0a%3c construct commonly used nonrandom mating schemes each time %0a%3c from scratch. Therefore, I have added a bunch of nonrandom %0a%3c mating schemes such as homogamy (using homogamousMating), %0a%3c polygyny and polyandry (using polygamousMating), random %0a%3c mating with alpha individuals (using alphaMating), and %0a%3c haplodiploid mating.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The last mating scheme requires native support of %0a%3c haplodiploid populations in the simuPOP core. Starting from %0a%3c this version, you can specify ploidy=Haplodiploid when you %0a%3c create a population. Recombinator acts differently in such a%0a%3c  population by copying the first copy of paternal %0a%3c chromosomes directly to an offspring.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c This version also addresses an concern of why %0a%3c simulator::evolve() has to specify ending generation, %0a%3c instead of how many generations to evolve. A new parameter%0a%3c  gen is introduced, and the use of the old parameter end is %0a%3c depreciated (working but with a warning message).%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!! Release of simuPOP 0.8.4 (Mar, 8, 2008)%0a%3c %0a%3c I am glad to announce the release of simuPOP 0.8.4. This %0a%3c release fixes a few bugs in the new mating schemes introduced%0a%3c in 0.8.2 and 0.8.3, and adds a few new features such as%0a%3c a combined splitter, operators infoEval and infoExec.%0a%3c A few examples of nonrandom mating schemes are added%0a%3c to the doc/cookbook directory. They will be explained%0a%3c in detail in an upcoming simuPOP cookbook.%0a%3c %0a%3c Users of advanced mating schemes are highly recommended %0a%3c to upgrade.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!! Release of simuPOP 0.8.3 (Jan 17, 2008)%0a%3c %0a%3c I am glad to announce the release of simuPOP 0.8.3. This%0a%3c version continues to improve non-random mating by adding %0a%3c pedigree tracing and handling capacities. For example, using %0a%3c parentTagger, one can now save the pedigree of the whole %0a%3c evolution, and replay the pedigree using a new pedigreeMating %0a%3c mating scheme. By creating a pedigree manually, it is easy to %0a%3c implement a gene-dropping algorithm using simuPOP.%0a%3c %0a%3c Functions in hapMapUtil.py are also updated when I use them for more hapMap-related simulations.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!! Release of simuPOP 0.8.2 (Nov, 19, 2007)%0a%3c %0a%3c Every major release of simuPOP introduces a major feature to%0a%3c simuPOP. For the 0.8.x series, simuPOP is making great %0a%3c progresses in the simulation of heterogeneous populations.%0a%3c This is achieved by the introduction of virtual %0a%3c subpopulations, and more flexible mating schemes. Operators%0a%3c are expected to work with virtual subpopulations soon.%0a%3c %0a%3c A 'virtual subpopulation' refers to any groups of individuals,%0a%3c defined by a 'virtual splitter'. For example, all males,%0a%3c all affected individuals, or all individuals having an %0a%3c information field age with value 5 can form a virtual%0a%3c subpopulation. In contrast to subpopulations, virtual%0a%3c subpopulations are dynamic because individual properties%0a%3c are variable.%0a%3c %0a%3c By setting virtual splitters to subpopulations, various%0a%3c operations can now be performed on specific virtual%0a%3c subpopulations. For example, it is now easy to calculate LD%0a%3c between affected individuals, or individuals with any %0a%3c other specific property. Future versions of simuPOP would %0a%3c allow heterogeneous mutation, recombination etc on different%0a%3c virtual subpopulations.%0a%3c %0a%3c In this release, the mating schemes are reorganized%0a%3c to allow heterogeneous mating schemes. Two important%0a%3c concepts: parents chooser and offspring generator%0a%3c are introduced. Different parent choosers and offspring%0a%3c generators can be combined freely to form arbitrary%0a%3c mating schemes. Moreover, different mating schemes%0a%3c can be applied to different subpopulation, even virtual%0a%3c subpopulations. For example, it is now possible to %0a%3c apply selfing to, e.g. 20%25 of the parents, and random mating%0a%3c to the rest of the parents. Using hybrid parents%0a%3c choosers, it is possible to implement aged population and%0a%3c non-random mating schemes that consider, for example,%0a%3c geographic information.%0a%3c %0a%3c Hybrid mating schemes tend to be slow because a parents%0a%3c chooser will be called repeatedly. If the algorithm of%0a%3c picking parents is complicated, it is recommended to%0a%3c implement this algorithm in C++. I have included a sample %0a%3c script scripts/demoNonRandomMating.py to demonstrate%0a%3c how to do this.%0a%3c %0a%3c Please refer to the relevant section of the user's%0a%3c guide and reference manual for details about virtual%0a%3c subpopulations, various virtual splitters, new mating %0a%3c schemes like selfMating, pyMating and heteroMating, and %0a%3c varous parents choosers and offspring generators.%0a%3c Although a lot of testing has been done, and the performance%0a%3c penalty of the new features has been kept minimal, normal%0a%3c users are not recommended to upgrade. I expect the new%0a%3c features to become mature in the 0.8.x release cycle.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!! Release of simuPOP 0.8.1 (Oct 05, 2007)%0a%3c %0a%3c I am glad to announce the release of simuPOP 0.8.1. This is%0a%3c a regular maintenance release with a few bug fixes and%0a%3c improvements. The first major new feature is that %0a%3c information fields can now be passed to pyPenetrance %0a%3c and pySelector operators, which allows easy simulations%0a%3c of environmental factors. In addiiton, chromNames parameter%0a%3c is added to the constructoe of population so that chromosome%0a%3c names can be tracked with function chromNames(), chromName()%0a%3c and chromByName() functions.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!! Release of simuPOP 0.8.0 (Aug 4, 2007)%0a%3c %0a%3c I am glad to announce the release of simuPOP 0.8.0, the %0a%3c result of more than one year's hard work since the release %0a%3c of simuPOP 0.7.0.%0a%3c %0a%3c This release contains numerous new features, optimization %0a%3c and bug fixes that greatly improve the use of information %0a%3c fields, binary modules, and the usability of simuPOP. Most %0a%3c importantly, with the help from a graduate research %0a%3c assistant, the online help system and simuPOP reference %0a%3c manual have been overhauled. I strongly encourage all%0a%3c simuPOP users to upgrade.%0a%3c %0a

On the contrary, it removes several %0a%3c rarely used features and adjusts the interface of several %0a%3c functions. For example, all arrBlah() functions are now %0a%3c marked obsolete. These functions can be used now, but will be %0a%3c removed when simuPOP 1.0 is released.%0a%3c %0a%3c Due to the change of interface, current simuPOP users are%0a%3c not encouraged to upgrade.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!

They were provided for historic%0a%3c reasons but do not stand a place in simuPOP after the %0a%3c windows/gzip bug is fixed. simuPOP files saved in these%0a%3c obsolete formats can still be loaded. Because simuPOP now%0a%3c support only one file format, file extension is no longer%0a%3c important. The recommended extensions are now .pop for%0a%3c populations and .sim for simulators.%0a%3c %0a%3c Due to the seriousness of a migration related bug, all %0a%3c simuPOP users are recommended to upgrade.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> Cheers,%0a> %0a
